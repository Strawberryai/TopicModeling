       "[\"I use to play this AGES ago and use to be pretty good. I started playing it again and I now found that the controls (at least for me) don't seem very forgiving. In order to do tricks you have to place the toggle in the exact correct place (at least pretty spot on). You also have to land in a specific position or else you crash (too many crashes makes it so you can't finish the race). The half-pipe mode is pretty decent though and can range from super easy to insanely hard. Overall a not so bad game for that time.\",\n",
       " \"this is the stuppidiest game i've ever played. I advise everyone not to play it or buy it. It really sucked.\",\n",
       " 'this game is the hardest game ive ever played, and that takes away the fun. also graphics very poor even for nintendo 64 cannot even recommend for people i dislike dont waste your time or money worst n64 game ever',\n",
       " 'If you don\\'t read anything else:If you find this game at a yard sale for $1.00 - $5.00 or online, then go ahead and get it, but in my opinion there are much better snow boarding games out for the N64, like \"Big Mountain 2000,\" \"Twisted Edge,\" or even \"Snowboard Kids\" or \"Snowboard Kids 2.\"Now I know that this was the N64\\'s first snowboarding game, so we shouldn\\'t expect the Taj Mahal in video game form here, but having played the previous mentioned snowboarding games and then playing this, there are some things that I dislike about this game. First, landing your snowboard in this game is more based on luck than skill. First, you have to press the \"Z\" button when you land and secondly you can\\'t move your control stick AT ALL when you are landing or your player is going to fall over because the board is on an angle on screen. That right there ruined the game for me because it sucked a lot of the fun right out of the game. Also, if you want to try to play this game, I recommend plugging in an N64 controller that has a joystick that is still very firm. I started playing with my usually controller, where the joystick is a little loose and I was pretty bad. Plugged in another controller with a firm joystick, got INSTANTLY BETTER controlling my character in the game! Second, if you bump a wall you fall over. There are other snowboarding games on the N64 that do that, but here it seemed really prevalent. Third, the music in this game is really annoying sounding. I liked the title track, but after that I was treated to songs that had people with high pitched or dull voices yelling the same things over and over again! I would have preffered just straight up instrumental music here. Fourth, I noticed that \"PRETTY MUCH\" the only way of winning a race against the computer player, was to take a short cut hidden in each course. Sure you could try to out board them, but if you mess up 2 or 3 times (hit a wall or wall over) FORGET WINNING!!! Fifth, when you enter the competition events, YOU ONLY GET SO MANY CONTINUES and let\\'s say you are playing on easy (Where there are 4 tracks) and you want to quit the 3rd race because you know you are going to lose and don\\'t want to waste a continue. So you go to select \"Restart\" from the pause menu. YOU ARE BACK ON THE FIRST COURSE AND HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING OVER AGAIN!!! AGGH!!! Sixth, I did some of the time attack modes, I believe that\\'s the right name for it. I am not positive right now.) Anyway, you have to board through certain goals (They look like a traditional marathon finish line) and I am playing the one level and the goal was on a cliff above me, that I had no chance of getting on from where I was and time ran out and I lost! WHY WOULD THEY PUT SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN THE GAME!!! Put the goal lines where people have a good chance of getting to them. Not up on a cliff, that I could of went up on, 8 seconds ago, but now I am stuck!!!I loved the look of this game! That\\'s why it was so hard for me to let go of the thought of getting fully into this game. I tried very hard to like this game, but I still couldn\\'t bring myself to do that because of the mentioned above flaws. If you can overlook them, and you have the taste for snowboarding games you should be able to enjoy this game. Happy playing and thanks for reading! Merry Christmas and best wishes for 2010 and beyond!!!',\n",
       " \"I played this game for week's years ago against a friend or 2 and it was great fun on multi-player. However when I played it one player I hated it. I thought it was too slow and real dodgy. But that was before I actually sat down and gave it a real go. And once you master the sliding/skid turn booster trick, it becomes a lot better.To do that; you just hold the R button down when going around bends and corners and tap the analogue stick in the opposite direction 3 times. The smoke goes from white, yellow to red then you let go the R and you have a slight boost. Once I had learned that it plays a lot faster.Overall, the graphics good and the levels are much bigger then the previous SNES version. But it lacks the same competitiveness and fun of the original version. But don't get me wrong, it is great for playing with friends, but it is a different feel from the original.In my opinion the best Mario Kart out is the GBA version because it is the SNES version with more tracks! (the original SNES tracks are unlockable in the GBA version!) But none the less, this version stands out on it's own.This version I didn't find to be as fun as the SNES one for a few reasons. They should have had more racers to choose from. And I miss my favourite driver the little Koopa Trooper, instead he's been taken out to make way for a slower Wario. But once I'd mastered that thing to take corners with, it was easy to place 1st in the 150cc.Overall, I give the one-player game 3 stars and the multiplayer 4.Cons: Not enough tracks and courses. Once you've mastered the courses on 150cc, there is no further challenges for you in single player mode.- Not enough drivers to choose.- The sound effects can be very annoying after a while (like Toads Whoa-Whoa-Whoa-Whoa sound)- No way to turn the objects off (like banana peels and the hazards of the coarse... it is really unfair sometimes)\",\n",
       " \"mario kart is not fun there is no secret characthers or secret places[i think]. I tried the game for an hour and was completly bored now i don't like racing games. The producers should have tried a little harder on this game i was completly unsatified.\",\n",
       " \"Mario Kart 64 Launched with the N64 and it sure did good with the sales but Ultimatley this is disapointing.  Mario Kart Succeds in graphics departure but Fails at the boring over and over gameplay that you indure in the game.  Don't get me wrong this is a great game but it just pretty much fail to fun factor.  Back when I got this game when It first came out I simply loved it but after the next day it kind of got boring for me.  The game is great but fails with the overuse of boring driving and nothing exciting happens.  If it were up to me I would have addes some really cool Driving maze level(yeah it does sound lame but what ever)In Graphics the game is simply superb.  It really does make the N64 a really good lookin' system.  The level desighning and great setups make it one of the better looking N64 back in the days when it was still popular..  It truly does make some Ps games look like crap.The sound is pretty average...ehh I rather not go into that..NOW.......The gameplay..It just get's boring after awhile and nothing special happens and the single player is pretty short.  But cool......And that's pretty much it.The Multiplayer is pretty fun.  I had a blast playing it with my friends.  It really is fun but like I said before...Nothing special.When it all comes down to this.  The boring yet kind of fun gameplay, Great Graphics but doesn't help gameplay, Really fun MP but still fails to succeed in fun factor(well atleast to me)I give Mario Kart 64 a 3.4 stars out of 5Lates..\",\n",

       " 'Every once in a while I experience a piece of entertainment that is *so* overrated it\\'s hard to believe I\\'m even living on the same planet as those that actually believe this is supposed to be the best. The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is that very piece of overrated entertainment. Talk about a video game that not only doesn\\'t live up to the hype (not even close) but it doesn\\'t do a darn thing to impress me even *if* I were to ignore all the exaggerated hype. This is a serious letdown of a video game. But again, please understand I\\'m not from the same planet as those that enjoy this game. I care about gameplay and replay value more than anything else. Apparently most Zelda fans believe puzzle-based dungeons and soulless overworlds are what defines the Zelda series.One thing that positively stinks is that the land of Hyrule, despite being presented as beautiful (and realistic- don\\'t tell me Nintendo wasn\\'t riding the 3D high in 1998 and going for realism here) it\\'s basically a gigantic piece of nothingness. Simply a means of getting from one area to another. A large, colorless empty field that Link either runs or rides his horse across. Nothing magical, medieval or interesting about *any* of this. It feels too much like taking a typical walk across the field beside my house. Going into this game after a Link to the Past, you\\'ll be scratching your head wondering what happened to the huge variety of overworld enemies, pretty and colorful environments and enticing obstacles. Remember all those trees, rocks, grass and water sections from Link to the Past? Remember how rich and vibrant they looked? Ha, nothing nearly as diverse is featured in this bland and inferior overworld. Oh sure the monsters come out at night (in predictable spots) but that\\'s it. As far as I can see, only one monster actually comes out (named Stalchild). Terribly lacking. The trees are spaced apart in a way that feels lacking too.The dungeons is where this game severely misses the mark to such an extent that it\\'s almost unfathomable to believe Nintendo thought releasing the game the way it is was enough to be sufficient. Again, where ARE all the enemies? Why am I roaming through temple rooms that are way too big for their own good? Are high ceilings and deep pits supposed to justify the lack of enemies because the tradeoff is that it feels like I\\'m really inside a castle now? Give me a break guys. The rooms are so big they basically have no life whatever. Instead of being loaded with enemies around every corner, these castles are alarmingly empty, lifeless and unacceptable. But... that\\'s apparently okay, because Ocarina of Time is the first 3D Zelda game so its legendary influence and innovation makes it leaps and bounds above the sequels, right? Not in my world baby. The games following Ocarina of Time perfected the Zelda formula way more effectively. Wind Waker and Skyward Sword leaves this dated mess in the dust.While normally I don\\'t care about graphics in a video game, you gotta admit that bright vibrant colors really make the epic heroic adventurous theme of the Zelda series more engrossing. This is just... gross. Only the realistic-looking (flawed) overworld is a sight to behold (which of course now looks significantly better in Twilight Princess). Clearly the effort involved in designing the dungeons isn\\'t much to admire. I don\\'t really mind the occasional choppiness concerning the edges of buildings, trees or other objects that are all part of the Nintendo 64\\'s datedness. Sometimes these unintentional features can be quite charming or, at the very least, forgiving. What I DO mind however is when these features are all over the place to the point of being a distraction, or having a game entirely too long so we\\'re forced to persevere these issues time and time again. In other words I\\'d be willing to forgive this particular shortcoming if the game made up for the choppy/uninspiring graphics in other areas. Sadly, it doesn\\'t. This isn\\'t even much of an issue compared to the other complaints I have (which I\\'ll mention below- keep reading). These graphics -especially the ones in the dungeons- resemble the ones found in the ruins of Mega Men Legends and the walls of the Quake series. The graphics in Link to the Past are unique and cannot be compared to any other game.Let\\'s discuss the dungeons, shall we? Despite being ridiculously and needlessly large with boring surroundings, most of them have such a small and uninteresting variety of enemies that it\\'s almost a chore going through one generic room after another. Ocarina of Time shows the makings of early 3D development at its most obvious- the platforms are predictable square structures that requires the player to spend most of his or her time lining up Link in order to make proper jumps by turning the camera until Link is positioned enough to reach the platform directly ahead. When you combine the constant requirement of having to change camera angles with having to position Link correctly all for the purpose of being able to see what you\\'re doing and where you\\'re going, it\\'s enough to make you think you\\'re playing with string puppets. Again, early 3D design flaws and datedness.The storytelling is really basic and predictable. It\\'s never elaborate like in Wind Waker or Skyward Sword. It\\'s mainly about rescuing or saving these mountainous cave creatures called Goron\\'s for the first half, and going back and forth from the past to the present in the second half. This is a really uninteresting way of time travelling that feels almost nonexistent due to being so poorly and unsatisfyingly implemented. It doesn\\'t even feel or look like you\\'re going 7 years into the future as Link\\'s appearance is supposed to be that of an older person but he doesn\\'t appear to be much different from his younger self. Oh sure he\\'s slightly bigger as an adult and slightly smaller as a kid but it\\'s very subtle. The music is the one area where the game succeeds quite amazingly however. All the theme songs are not only appropriate for the environments, but melodic and memorable. Several dungeon themes are well-made and believably chilling and haunting. The right ingredients were definitely put into the music-making aspect of the game. The Hyrule overworld theme is enjoyable too and won\\'t get on your nerves despite all the time you will undoubtedly spend there.The dungeons are either incredibly simplistic with strategies that involve the overbearingly dull and overused crate-pushing to open up portals or switches, or hopelessly generic \"I\\'m stuck in a maze and I can\\'t get out\" frustration that is an inconvenient trademark of early 3D game design. But... these aren\\'t any ordinary mazes. These are mazes where your surroundings look identical around every turn, hence the flawed early 3D game design. A cheap way of making a maze seem more difficult than it has to be, or in other words, needlessly difficult chores instead of exciting castle exploration which is what made the 2D Zelda\\'s so memorable. Sometimes you have to light torches with arrows or by other means, and quite often you have to collect 5 silver rupees to activate a switch/open a door. Collecting these silver rupees is WAY too similar to Super Mario 64 with the red coins. The Lost Woods is a tunnel-infested maze with no personality whatsoever. The Lost Woods -if you plan on getting everything the game has to offer- will most definitely be the source of endless frustration.The enemies, or rather, what little enemies you will stumble upon on your \"adventure\" through the temples, is probably the most aggravating part of the entire game. These dungeons are sorely in need of something to spice them up and make them pleasurable. You will often go 3 or 4 rooms at a time without seeing a single enemy. Why even have a sword? In the 2D games the idea was simple- just load or overload the rooms with a variety of enemies and, guess what? *Now* the dungeons are exciting. A genius idea really. Here? In Ocarina of Time? It\\'s all about atmosphere. It\\'s all about featuring as little opposing danger as possible so you can absorb what was once Nintendo\\'s most recent creation back in 1998. But... Nintendo forgot to take into account that technology will inevitably advance and a game relying on atmosphere above everything else will eventually suffer and become inferior one day. What was once a brand new puppy in 1998 is now a tired old dog thanks to the surroundings being boring and incredibly basic in their design. Video game technology is destined to advance making a game like this completely forgettable. That\\'s exactly what has happened with Ocarina of Time- it hasn\\'t stood the test of time.Do you really think those poorly animated mechanical blue tektite spiders in the water dungon are worthy of a Zelda game? Seriously? Their animations are so stiff due to the Nintendo 64\\'s limitations as a console that it\\'s unbearable to deal with them and laughable at the way they lunge towards Link. But even then, *most* dungeon enemies fall way short of acceptable. Big Skulltula is a laughably bland attempt at being dangerous- it\\'s more like a nuisance when one of these comes down out of nowhere while you\\'re running around. The spikes that roll around are incredibly basic and uninteresting. Somehow *all* the enemies manage to never once be memorable. Ever! Ocarina of Time has dated horrendously, seriously. Wolfos are unintetionally funny with their choppy movements and the dated howling sounds they make, Red Bubble is basically the same thing as Big Skulltula but on fire, and Gibdos are boring. The ReDead\\'s let out a hilarious scream that freezes Link in place which is inconvenient when you\\'re trying to get up the ladder right in front of you and even more inconvenient when you\\'re stuck in a room with two of them. Mummies are poorly designed since all you have to do is hookshot them, run behind them, and slice them with your sword. To be fair, some enemies are cool such as Deku Baba where it\\'s best to snap its vine with the sword for an instant kill- creatively well done there. The Deku Scrub where you can block or sword swipe its shooting seeds with the shield and ricochet the seeds back at them is neat. And the Lizalfos and Dinalfos basically serve as mini bosses due to being somewhat harder and more sophisticated than the other ordinary enemies.The game overall has a shortage of rupees. They\\'re really not that important which is odd. This is the first Zelda game I\\'ve ever played where rupees feel more like an afterthought. Not something to take real seriously. If you don\\'t feel like collecting them, then don\\'t- no harm done. The bosses are alright except for the irritating one in the water dungeon. You have to repeatedly hookshot him while standing next to the platform. It takes FOREVER (and no, this boss is *nowhere* as fun as the water dungeon in Link to the Past in case you\\'re wondering). The hookshot is used MORE than the sword throughout the game because it serves as an effective weapon quite often. The hookshot is a highly recommended weapon to use in a variety of situations, but especially important when collecting these things called gold skulltulas. After you collect 10 gold skulltula tokens, you get a beneficial reward. You can only collect them after defeating the gold skulltula enemy (usually found on walls). I admit I love the witches you face in the Spirit Temple. While the temple itself is really short and boring, it\\'s probably worth going through it so you can face the two witches that make for a rather entertaining boss fight. You have to use your shield to reflect shots at the *other* witch, and it\\'s really fun and creative. The hookshot\\'s basically a required item to properly deal with hard-shelled or spiked enemies in the dungeons and it\\'s annoying that it\\'s used WAY more frequently than the sword throughout the game. Due to how much precision is required to use the hookshot, using this item becomes a very tedious chore after a while (especially if you keep missing your target) and it slows down the pace of the game by a lot.If you haven\\'t noticed yet, the water dungeon in Ocarina of Time is just abominable. I bring it up often to remind people how terrible a dungeon can be in every possible way. Also, the worst influence ever occurs here- the importance of playing the ocarina musical instrument for a variety of reasons (mostly for warping from one place to another). Nintendo really overdid this aspect of the game by implementing the ocarina WAY too many darn times. It\\'s overdone. Just hurry up and play the darn song and move on for goodness sake. Don\\'t make it so you have to play the ocarina up to 50 times, if not more. I never really counted how many times I used it. It was a lot. It severely drags the gameplay, atmosphere and excitement down and immediately drags the game to a screeching halt having to frequently stop and play these songs on the ocarina. Watching Link stand around and play the instrument is the fruitiest thing I\\'ve ever seen. No wonder people think Nintendo makes nothing but kids games these days. This game is partly responsible for that belief due to its influence.Ganon\\'s castle is supposed to be exhilarating and suspenseful. It\\'s supposed to be filled with dangerous traps, tricky puzzles and enemies all over the place. But... the one in Ocarina of Time falls way short of being presentable by normal Legend of Zelda standards. Instead the castle is dominated with mini quests where you have to go through 6 trials to dispel the main barrier. The problem is that each trial contains really simple and short rooms where you only spend a couple minutes in each one performing the same tasks that you already had to do in the previous dungeons such as collecting 5 silver rupees. This is the complete opposite of being overwhelmingly threatening. Another bonus point for Link to the Past. Oh and the Ganon fight? His strategy is stolen from Agahnim\\'s battle from Link to the Past but takes SEVERAL more minutes to bring down. Remember how you fought Agahnim? Yup, same exact strategy but in a 3D world. Sigh. The second part of the Ganon fight (after a looooong and tedious time-based departure from the top of a castle) is to shoot arrows at Ganon and hit his glowing behind several times. It\\'s really easy, all of it. However fighting him in one of the early dungeons (Forest Temple) is actually one of the most memorable in the entire Zelda series. This is because Ganon rides a horse in and out of these picture frames hanging on the wall making for a VERY unique graphics effect and perhaps an original concept. Reminds me of a Harry Potter movie.A few other complaints. Fishing is sort of fun but nothing really noteworthy. It\\'s better than most fishing games I\\'ve played in other games I admit. Expect to be sitting and fishing a while in order to get the heart piece however. Most heart pieces are pretty challenging to acquire and take some serious effort to get most of them. That\\'s a rare compliment I can give. Some of the other mini games such as riding a horse and shooting targets is pretty fun. I don\\'t really like that part in the desert where you have to follow a ghost through a dust storm. If you fall behind even a *little* bit you\\'ll lose. Performing this same ghost-chasing task earlier in the game in order to obtain the hookshot is more exciting since you\\'re dodging fireballs. The other task earlier on in the game in the Ice Cavern that involves throwing blue fire over red fire is really overlong and entirely puzzle-based. Having to do this once or twice would have been suitable- not 15-20 times. This particular place is a victim of platforms that are basic and uninteresting.Basically, when compared to the 2D games, Ocarina of Time only feels like half a game due to the dramatic change of turning the Zelda series into 3D but only giving us a small portion of what\\'s available in Link to the Past. As a result the game feels incomplete on too many occasions. It\\'s because the Nintendo 64 is a limited console that\\'s really only able to handle so much. Ocarina of Time comes up way short. Even the first couple hours are disappointing since it takes forever to actually get going. Avoiding being detected by guards isn\\'t fun after the first time. Oh and speaking of avoiding detection- this game actually has a Metal Gear Solid stealth-style mission later on where you have to free these imprisoned carpenter people. The stealth is so underutilized and simplistic that this is the second biggest chore in the game next to the water dungeon. Equally annoying is upon freeing the 4 carpenters, these red sword-swinging enemies appear on screen. The SAME EXACT ENEMY 4 times in a row with *no* differences between any of them. At first these battles seem hard until you realize all you really have to do is lunge your sword directly at them about 5 times, and they fall over and die.Reading text and having boring discussions with Zelda, trees and other semi-interesting characters doesn\\'t get the job done either. Ganon even seems significantly less threatening than usual (that one conversation with Zelda and Link with Ganon patrolling the hallways nearby in Hyrule Castle comes to mind here). I will admit that some of the flame-covered cutscenes involving Ganon riding his horse is very intimidating. The cutscene outside the bridge of Hyrule Castle comes to mind here. Otherwise, Ganon\\'s presented uninterestingly. You\\'re *supposed* to get a feeling of hopelessness that Ganon is going to take over the world and wipe the people out but... due to a culmination of the above mentioned problems, Ganon being a ruthless villain doesn\\'t ever materialize (at least, he\\'s not as scary as he *should* be).Recognize Ocarina of Time for making the 3D Zelda series exist. That\\'s fair. It allowed Wind Waker to eventually be created which in turn made the 3D Zelda formula better starting from that game until now. By 2003 Nintendo was working with the technologically superior Gamecube console which allowed the Zelda series to be fully realized in all major categories (gameplay, graphics, replay value and excitement). I say avoid Ocarina of Time but hey, nobody will listen or agree with me anyway so carry on and have a wonderful day!']"

      "Fans of the N64 wrestling game series waited long for a next-gen successor to take Nintendo to the next level of sports entertainement.  They will have to keep waiting.Wrestlemania X8 sports what feels very much like Smackdown,  but lacks many of the features the Smackdown series made it big for.  The Create a Wrestler (CAW) system,  while creating smooth wrestlers,  is very limited.  Here's a rundown:Graphics:  The graphics are great in some places,  but are inconsistant.  While some wreslters look very much like their counterparts,  many don't.  The movements onscreen are rather jerky and don't quite line up.  It's a step up from previous Nintendo platform games,  but nothing for a next gen system.Sound:  The only complaint I've come up with so far,  from myself or others is that the levels are a bit low.  If cranking your stereo or TV up a couple of notches is the only problem,  you're pretty much standing on solid ground.  The sound does indeed need some extra volume,  but is otherwise excellent.Controls:  The controls are clumsy and unintuitive.  While they're not impossible to manage,  many commands double for mulptiple things you might attempt to do in the same circumstances.  The instruction manual is horribly organized for attempting to find what buttons you hit to perform what.Gameplay:  Well,  this is what matters in a wrestling game.  Controls,  as mentioned above,  are unintuitive,  but responsive at the very least.  Timing seems less important in this game,  compared to other titles.The moveset is incredibly limited.  No Mercy had 16 different grapple moves per wrestler (Counting only front grapples for simplicity in this review),  Smackdown had ten,  WM X8 has 5. The selection of grapple options is pretty limited too.Pre-release hype pointed to slower,  more realistic gameplay,  and better &quot;selling&quot; of moves (Selling refers to taking the move and making it look good).  The gameplay is slower than the mindless funger numbing pound-any-button-and-win frenzy of smackdown,  but win strategies are still pretty limited.  As for the &quot;sell time,&quot;  expect your opponents to stay down only a little longer after a Twist of Fate or Stone Cold Stunner than if they had been nailed with an Eye rake or Fireman Carry.The grappling is also a holdover from Smackdown.  What is there of No Mercy in this game,  as we were promised?  Not much.  Attacks to the groin give a &quot;ding&quot; sound,  and the countering system uses a foundation based off of No Mercy.  However,  whereas there were dozens of possible counters,  including varied reversals for heavyweights,  light heavyweights,  an martial artists,  there is usually only one reversal to a move,  and most are shared among many,  many moves.  Finishers can be reversed,  however.Among the good are a wide variety of matches,  every sort of match your little heart could desire,  provided it makes a showing on WWF/E TV.  HEll in a Cell,  Cage,  Tornado Tag,  etc.To summarize the gameplay,  it plays like a cheesy arcade game.  In the early nineties,  we moved away from this kind of game for just that reason.  It's return is unwelcome,  and its demise will not be mourned.Create a Wreslter:  Sadly,  the CAW works like the Smackdown series,  without the benefit of all the options.  Selections are limited and hardly sufficient for coming up with a wrestler that is anything more than a hodge podge of the current pop favorites.  The CAW system from Smackdowns 2 and 3 was a huge selling point,  even to people disappointed with the gameplay.  This is but a pale imitation of better systems.Wrestlemania X8 has remained a fairly big disappointment.

Despite the fact that the green plumber lacks the highest of the high eminence when compared to his counterpart`s Super Mario World and Mario 64, Luigi's Mansion sends the player on one of the topmost experiences a game can frankly provide.  Although it does not live up to the demoralizing hopes for a weekly played platformer, Luigi's new 2D-like dance is incredible in all its rights.  Conversely, not taking the vital steps as a boundless platformer, Luigi's Mansion has one sticky, discernible shortcoming.  Spanning only and about six hours, the game will be a mixture of being awestruck or deeply saddened for those rummaging for a clear-cut Mario sequel.Luigi's Mansion lobs the player as Luigi, a spineless Ghostbuster.  Armed with a flashlight, the Hoover (a vacuum cleaner), and a Game Boy Horror (which serves as a  map), the mildly brave Luigi must investigate a haunted Mansion where each corner and crevice must be thoroughly searched for interleaving puzzles.  The puzzles work as a chain of sequence throughout the game, marking advancement into the vast halls.  Each room, gushing with several hordes of terrorizing ghouls, must be explored in order to attain keys where entry is denied.  The regular, constant ghosts found to and fro the game are vanquished easily.  By screening the flashlight on a ghoul, a significant number of HP will appear, and the player must completely nullify that number.  Operating the Hoover, Luigi will be thrown left and right while the skirmishing ghost endeavors not to be sucked into oblivion.  Gradually, its HP will melt down, reaching 0 and finally being bagged.  Sounds very simple, no?  Well, soon the rules are altered as new, nastier, and more technique-employed ghosts come screeching down the halls.  If the player is stomped on how to thrash a certain ghost, simply utilizing the Game Boy Horror will force the phantom to discharge a hint on ripping them apart.  Other ghosts, intent on not letting the player see them, unveil themselves once Luigi carries out particular tasks.  Subsequently, Luigi goes face to face with immense bosses that require different tactics to slaughter.  On the dot, Luigi's Mansion keeps and repeats this gameplay pattern., not really making up for its abrupt conclusion and obvious repetitiveness.On the graphical standpoint, this is beyond what other previous consoles have come close to imitate.  Remembering when the PlayStation tried to encapsulate fitting cartoony looks, the GameCube scoffs at all preceding efforts, pulling off the greatest type of cartoon visuals ever.  Running at 30 frames per second, making use of spotless lighting, shadow, and transparency effects, Luigi's Mansion will have any kid ditch the teletubbies, and glue their faces onto the pulsating gaming screen.  Luigi has a original collection of facial expressions.  Moving gracefully, without any slowdown, the player and his surroundings are planed in a radiance of lightly colored backgrounds and an overwhelming number of illumination effects.  Just the little threads of detail in the game give a hint on how future GameCube titles will be furnished around dazzling tapestries.  As if to counter this pro, the musical soundtrack are rather lackluster and utterly uninspiring.  While the game's many sounds (Luigi humming to himself) and all the other jingles are up-to-the-par with quality, the redundant music recurs over and over and over. . .Even though my gaming hunger for the next Mario platform is months away (Mario Sunshine), Luigi's Mansion proves to be a wistful frolic until the ornate mind of Miyamoto breaks all the gaming rules yet again.  Lavishing some good innovation, save for the succinctness on the hours, the game is a demanding buy, but well worth a revisit on the all-star plumbers.\n",

      "Mario's first portable adventure, though fun while it lasts (which isn't long), is the weakest entry in the \"Super Mario\" franchise.  The tone of the game, while clearly modeled after the original \"Super Mario Bros.\" for the NES, has a much different feel to it than [any other Mario time] Mario game.  That is because Shigeru Miyamoto did not produce the game; instead, his mentor, Gunpei Yokoi, produced and directed the title.Yokoi, who was killed in a car accident in 1997 in Japan, was Miyamoto's mentor.  It was because of Yokoi that Miyamoto's game \"Donkey Kong\" came before the leaders of Nintendo at the time.  Yokoi came up with the Game & Watch series, \"Kid Icarus\" and \"Metroid\" for the NES, and the Gameboy.  (A \"Metroid\" enemy even makes a cameo appearance in \"Super Mario Land\").The game features elements not seen before (or since) in the Mario series, including Egyptian themed bosses (although the Egypt theme is common in Mario, the bosses from SML are never heard of again, just like SMB2), space aliens, an apparent unending fascination with Easter Island and its Moi heads, and even two Shooting levels.  Although Miyamato revealed in an \"Iwata Asks\" interview that the original \"Super Mario Bros.\" was going to have shooting levels, and the coin heavens are left over fragments of that idea (along with Mario having a gun), this idea was never implemented in the core series with the sole exception of \"Super Mario Land\".I grew up with Mario, like most other gamers. With only two exceptions, I have played every Mario title at launch or shortly thereafter, from the original 1985 \"Super Mario Bros\" all the way down to \"New Super Mario Bros. 2\" (yes I'm old). Obviously being American we didn't get \"Lost Levels\" until \"Super Mario All-Stars\", but I got the SNES version when it was released back in '93 and have played through \"Lost Levels\" so many times over the years I've more than made up for not getting it back in 1986.Anyway, the two I missed? \"Super Mario Land\" for the Gameboy (which I did play very briefly back when it first came out, but I never had it; we went with \"Super Mario Land 2\" instead when I did get a Gameboy) and \"Super Mario Sunshine\".  The very few times that I did play the game on the original Gameboy back in 1989 or the very early 1990s, I do remember getting as far as the first boss, which means I was a fourth of the way done.Being the Mario fan that I am, I did play through \"Super Mario Land\" on emulator a couple of years back, beating  the game over two decades after it was first released. [Before I really played the game I remember getting as far as the first boss, which means I was a fourth of the way done].  Since then, I purchased the title on the 3DS Virtual Console (love those restore points!)So my thoughts on the game?  Well, of all the Mario games, this is easily the most insubstantial title in the entire franchise of proper \"Super Mario\" games (I am not including spin-offs and subseries).  \"Super Mario Land\" was a launch title for the Gameboy, and boy does it show.  The majority of the sprites are small, including Mario himself.  Being monochrome, it can be hard to see what is going on given how small the sprites are as well as how small the screen is. The game is SHORT - only twelve levels.  Each level has about a 400 second time limit, so to do a full run through of the game, even dragging your feet, will not net you much gameplay in terms of time.Due to Miyamoto's lack of involvement, the setting and overall enemy roster feels quite different than other Mario titles.  There are octupuses, jumping flowers that shoot fire (reminds of me of Panser from \"Super Mario Bros. 2\", Gaos (they resemble Egyptian sphinxes), robots (!!), Totais (running Easter Island Moai  heads), Pionpis (jumping men who shoot at Mari in the last world) and Yurarin Boos, who are fire-breathing seahorses.  The last two are the most interesting, as they are heavily reminesnt of \"Metroid\".  The Pionpis reminds me of Samus Aran's female sprite when the JUSTIN BAILEY code is entered, and the Yurarin Boos are identical to the seahorses (in terms of game play and species type, though the sprites differ somewhat) in \"Metroid\" as well.The game is set in Sarasaland, comprised of four kingdoms, Birabuto, Muda, Easton and Chai.  Suddenly an evil space alien named Tatanga appears, kidnaps Princess Daisy (who debuts in this game), and it is up to Mario to rescue the Princess (but it's not Princess Peach at least).Probably my biggest complaint about the game, besides the short length, is the looseness in the controls.  I don't know if this holds true for the original Gameboy (I suspect it does), but playing on the 3DS, I found Mario often times going slightly further than I wanted, [or not far enough].  I've never hard this problem with the other Mario games.  There is also some weird hit detection issues going on.  I was playing 4-2, jumped up on a pipe with a pirana plant and definitely hit the plant, and Mario did not lose his power up.  I've seen this happen multiple times.The loose play control further exacerbates another issue: no saving.  If you run out of lives (unless you're on 4-3, the very last world), you have to start all over which can be frustrating.  If you die on the last level you do get two continues.  Often times due to the loose play control I would slightly overshoot where I was jumping and Mario would plummet to his death.  Now, to be fair, to expect such a short game all the way back in 1989 to having saving is ridiculous, but none the less the criticism holds that there is some inherent frustration having to start all the way over.  Nintendo could have at least provided continues (a more realistic option for a game of this age).  .The game is clearly modelled on the original \"Super Mario Bros.\", although with some noticable differences.  First, the music itself is unlike anything else in the series, and is one of the strongest assests the game offers.  Just like the first game, you can't go back to the left; the screen only scrolls right.  Mario's sprite is also modelled on his sprite from the NES title.The power ups are pretty weak.  There are exactly three: the Super mushroom, the Super Ball, and an invincibility star.  The Super Mushroom will make Mario big.  The Super Ball (this game's idiotic version of the Fire Flower) allows Mario to shoot projectiles.  However, the key difference between the fireflower and the super ball is that when you shoot the Super Ball, the ball will bounce off the flower floor and go up until it hits another surface.  So on levels that are pretty open, you shoot the Super Ball, it hits the ground right in front of Mario, and then shoots straight up into the sky, never to be seen again, rendering this power up effectively useless unless the enemies are right up by you, creating a bigger margin for error.  If you are in a more enclosed space, the ball will bounce around against the various surfaces until it either hits an enemy or times out.  Unfortunately you can only shoot one at a time, so if you have one bouncing around and it's not connecting with an enemy, you have to either go on or wait and try shooting whatever your aiming for after the first ball disappears.Like the other Mario titles, \"Super Mario Land\" would prove to be a massive hit, selling over eighteen million copies in its initial run.  What's depressing to me is that \"Super Mario Land\" actually outsold the far superior \"Super Mario Bros. 3\".  Note: that does not count the rereleases and Virtual Console sales, only the intial NES release vs. the Gameboy release.For a game of its time, the title is pretty fun.  But of all the games in the core \"Super Mario\" series, this is easily the least substantial title, due to its brevity, the loose play controls, and the overall disconnection from the rest of the series.  The games sequel, \"Super Mario Land 2: Six Golden Coins\", is infinitely better, with bigger sprites, more engaging gameplay, and a much longer gametime.  The music though from SML is, admittedly, fantastic and is probably its strongest point.Mario's first portable adventure, though fun while it lasts (which isn't long), is the weakest entry in the \"Super Mario\" franchise.

Mario is like The Beatles - pretty much everything from the core series is top of the line and tremendously polished, sells massive amounts of product, and is loved the world over.  Even a substandard Mario game is better than so many other games out there.  That being said though pretty much any other Mario game is better than this one.  Unless you have a nostalgic attachment to this game or you just want to play Mario's first portable adventure, there's not a lot of reason to go back to this unless you've played the other Mario games first.  This one should be down pretty far on your list..\n",

(A \"Metroid\" enemy even makes a cameo appearance in \"Super Mario Land\").The game features elements not seen before (or since) in the Mario series, including Egyptian themed bosses (although the Egypt theme is common in Mario, the bosses from SML are never heard of again, just like SMB2), space aliens, an apparent unending fascination with Easter Island and its Moi heads, and even two Shooting levels.  Although Miyamato revealed in an \"Iwata Asks\" interview that the original \"Super Mario Bros.\" was going to have shooting levels, and the coin heavens are left over fragments of that idea (along with Mario having a gun), this idea was never implemented in the core series with the sole exception of \"Super Mario Land\".I grew up with Mario, like most other gamers. With only two exceptions, I have played every Mario title at launch or shortly thereafter, from the original 1985 \"Super Mario Bros\" all the way down to \"New Super Mario Bros. 2\" (yes I'm old). Obviously being American we didn't get \"Lost Levels\" until \"Super Mario All-Stars\", but I got the SNES version when it was released back in '93 and have played through \"Lost Levels\" so many times over the years I've more than made up for not getting it back in 1986.Anyway, the two I missed? \"Super Mario Land\" for the Gameboy (which I did play very briefly back when it first came out, but I never had it; we went with \"Super Mario Land 2\" instead when I did get a Gameboy) and \"Super Mario Sunshine\".  The very few times that I did play the game on the original Gameboy back in 1989 or the very early 1990s, I do remember getting as far as the first boss, which means I was a fourth of the way done.Being the Mario fan that I am, I did play through \"Super Mario Land\" on emulator a couple of years back, beating  the game over two decades after it was first released. [Before I really played the game I remember getting as far as the first boss, which means I was a fourth of the way done].  Since then, I purchased the title on the 3DS Virtual Console (love those restore points!)So my thoughts on the game?  Well, of all the Mario games, this is easily the most insubstantial title in the entire franchise of proper \"Super Mario\" games (I am not including spin-offs and subseries).  \"Super Mario Land\" was a launch title for the Gameboy, and boy does it show.  The majority of the sprites are small, including Mario himself.  Being monochrome, it can be hard to see what is going on given how small the sprites are as well as how small the screen is. The game is SHORT - only twelve levels.  Each level has about a 400 second time limit, so to do a full run through of the game, even dragging your feet, will not net you much gameplay in terms of time.Due to Miyamoto's lack of involvement, the setting and overall enemy roster feels quite different than other Mario titles.  There are octupuses, jumping flowers that shoot fire (reminds of me of Panser from \"Super Mario Bros. 2\", Gaos (they resemble Egyptian sphinxes), robots (!!), Totais (running Easter Island Moai  heads), Pionpis (jumping men who shoot at Mari in the last world) and Yurarin Boos, who are fire-breathing seahorses.  The last two are the most interesting, as they are heavily reminesnt of \"Metroid\".  The Pionpis reminds me of Samus Aran's female sprite when the JUSTIN BAILEY code is entered, and the Yurarin Boos are identical to the seahorses (in terms of game play and species type, though the sprites differ somewhat) in \"Metroid\" as well.The game is set in Sarasaland, comprised of four kingdoms, Birabuto, Muda, Easton and Chai.  Suddenly an evil space alien named Tatanga appears, kidnaps Princess Daisy (who debuts in this game), and it is up to Mario to rescue the Princess (but it's not Princess Peach at least).Probably my biggest complaint about the game, besides the short length, is the looseness in the controls.  I don't know if this holds true for the original Gameboy (I suspect it does), but playing on the 3DS, I found Mario often times going slightly further than I wanted, [or not far enough].  I've never hard this problem with the other Mario games.  There is also some weird hit detection issues going on.  I was playing 4-2, jumped up on a pipe with a pirana plant and definitely hit the plant, and Mario did not lose his power up.  I've seen this happen multiple times.The loose play control further exacerbates another issue: no saving.  If you run out of lives (unless you're on 4-3, the very last world), you have to start all over which can be frustrating.  If you die on the last level you do get two continues.  Often times due to the loose play control I would slightly overshoot where I was jumping and Mario would plummet to his death.  Now, to be fair, to expect such a short game all the way back in 1989 to having saving is ridiculous, but none the less the criticism holds that there is some inherent frustration having to start all the way over.  Nintendo could have at least provided continues (a more realistic option for a game of this age).  .The game is clearly modelled on the original \"Super Mario Bros.\", although with some noticable differences.  First, the music itself is unlike anything else in the series, and is one of the strongest assests the game offers.  Just like the first game, you can't go back to the left; the screen only scrolls right.  Mario's sprite is also modelled on his sprite from the NES title.The power ups are pretty weak.  There are exactly three: the Super mushroom, the Super Ball, and an invincibility star.  The Super Mushroom will make Mario big.  The Super Ball (this game's idiotic version of the Fire Flower) allows Mario to shoot projectiles.  However, the key difference between the fireflower and the super ball is that when you shoot the Super Ball, the ball will bounce off the flower floor and go up until it hits another surface.  So on levels that are pretty open, you shoot the Super Ball, it hits the ground right in front of Mario, and then shoots straight up into the sky, never to be seen again, rendering this power up effectively useless unless the enemies are right up by you, creating a bigger margin for error.  If you are in a more enclosed space, the ball will bounce around against the various surfaces until it either hits an enemy or times out.  Unfortunately you can only shoot one at a time, so if you have one bouncing around and it's not connecting with an enemy, you have to either go on or wait and try shooting whatever your aiming for after the first ball disappears.Like the other Mario titles, \"Super Mario Land\" would prove to be a massive hit, selling over eighteen million copies in its initial run.  What's depressing to me is that \"Super Mario Land\" actually outsold the far superior \"Super Mario Bros. 3\".  Note: that does not count the rereleases and Virtual Console sales, only the intial NES release vs. the Gameboy release.For a game of its time, the title is pretty fun.  But of all the games in the core \"Super Mario\" series, this is easily the least substantial title, due to its brevity, the loose play controls, and the overall disconnection from the rest of the series.  The games sequel, \"Super Mario Land 2: Six Golden Coins\", is infinitely better, with bigger sprites, more engaging gameplay, and a much longer gametime.  The music though from SML is, admittedly, fantastic and is probably its strongest point.While there aren't really any BAD Mario games (they all very fun), there are definitely some top tier Mario games.  Mario is like The Beatles - pretty much everything from the core series is top of the line and tremendously polished, sells massive amounts of product, and is loved the world over.  Even a substandard Mario game is better than so many other games out there.  That being said though pretty much any other Mario game is better than this one.  Unless you have a nostalgic attachment to this game or you just want to play Mario's first portable adventure, there's not a lot of reason to go back to this unless you've played the other Mario games first.  This one should be down pretty far on your list..\n",
      "I remember the first time I played Metroid on the (8 bit)Nintendo. It was a side scroller, soI saw Samus (the character you control)from afar, and I actuallybelieved Samus was a robot, not a woman in an armour.Metroid was fun, because you got to run around in severalworlds with different environments, get new guns, shoot downscary monsters, and you got to playaround with the thought &quot;I wonder what it's like for Samusto stand on that platform right now. Isn't he (she) afraid of heights?What is it like to look at this world through Samus's eyes?&quot;So several years later later Metroid Prime enters the scene,and my last question was answered: Technology has made itpossible to now see the environment through Samus's eyes,and we have video sequences now that clearly state that Samus is awoman.I always thought that it was I who was getting older, sincegames fascinated me less and less. But maybe, it was the gamesthemselves. Metroid Prime is dull. The game leaves nothingto the imagination like the first Metroid games.Everything you see (through Samus), is what you get. What wasfun with Metroid was that when you jumped and missed a platformyou would get a stomach sensation as if falling. Why?Because your concentration was entirely on making that jump.In Metroid Prime you just know you missed the jump, becauseyou just fell down, no way of knowing where your feet are,or where to place them to make the jump.So I guess that's my point about Metroid Prime. Mario made it to 3D,not Castlevania, and I guess not Metroid either. Give the playersome limitations, and see the player make up for it in imagination:When the mind is communicating with the game, see the game thrive.In Metroid Prime, the player has everything she or he needs,no imagination required.. So the game feels more like a chore,than a game. Make a stand for 2D and bring Metroid back to itsoriginal place. Maybe I'll just buy a gameboy advance, justto finally make that jump.\n",

      "So... Mario vs Donkey Kong. Nintendo's latest shameless capitalization of a once-venerable series of games. I bit the bullet and started playing this recently, curiosity winning out over the recent experiences with Mario-branded games. Despite such tragedies of game design of the last 10 years like Mario Sunshine and Wario World, I still harbor warm feelings for the Mario games of the late 20th century, forgetting time and again that as their management and lead designers age and stagnate, fun, clever, original games like those are seemingly forever in Nintendo's past.The game started out alright, an interesting puzzle-focused twist on the main-sequence Super Mario series... they eliminated the venerable stomping-enemies-and-grabbing-power-ups formula, and replaced it entirely with simple logic puzzles in underwhelming levels usually no larger than two screens' worth. You can still jump around, but Mario's jumping range is no higher than about twice his height, which for Mario is absolutely pathetic. He also moves at a constant rate of speed no matter how long he's been running, making nimble jumps practically impossible, and skids randomly when he stops; I found myself constantly plunging into crevasses and falling off cliffs, wondering with utterly genuine surprise and confusion why the character was receiving commands I wasn't inputting. Probably the biggest sin of all, though, is the ludicrously short distance he can fall before pancaking on the ground and whining like a toddler. And if you're falling while holding something, he'll pitch the item across the screen once you've fallen a certain distance, forcing you to retrieve it once he's done feeling sorry for himself.Also, Mario's got the same voice actor they've been using in Mario games for years, Charles Martinet, who produces an entirely testicle-free whiny broken falsetto soaked in an Italian accent that rings less authentically than a Wichita Godfather's Pizza commercial. After maybe 20 minutes of gameplay, I was nearly in tears, begging the gods of video games to make him shut up... even if you're Mother Teresa, you can only really hear that \"Mama Mia!\" croon a limited number of times before a primal urge to exterminate mankind kicks in. And god help you if you let the rescued mini-Marios fall off the screen on the Mini Mario levels: until you retrieve all of them, which can sometimes take a while, they'll continuously shriek \"Oh, Mario!\" every second or so like starving lupine infants, producing a sensation that I can only describe as cannibalistic rage mixed with crippling nausea. One of the biggest letdowns in the game is the inability to pitch these mewling little parasites into an active caldera, forever silencing their demonic little voices.Donkey Kong himself is probably the strangest part of the game, though. During the opening cinematic, we see DK sitting on his fat simian butt in his house, flipping idly through channels, until he sees a commercial advertising some kind of weird mini Mario dolls. Then, suddenly, hearts appear in DK's eyes. I am not making this up. It appears to anyone with more than one digit in their age that Donkey Kong is either harboring a secret lust for everyone's favorite effeminate plumber, or has a sick fetish for plushie toys. The latter becomes evident as we see DK break into the factory and steal one sack full of mini-Marios, crippling the entire toy doll industry. Apparently in their panic, the ubiquitous, androgenous little toadstool slaves forgot they could just turn the machines back on and... uh, you know.... just, uh, make more. Instead, Mario comes to the rescue and follows DK through six worlds of improbable puzzles, rescuing one mini Mario on every level.So yeah, yet another failed opportunity to restore the Mario franchise to some mote of its former glory.  I'm sure Nintendo won't care as it'll still undoubtedly make them money, but it's yet another shovel working to dig their corporate grave.\n",

      "When I first sat down with this game, I was in total awe.  With updated graphics, remixed music, better sounds, newer areas, and a map (yes, for the young kids, the original Metroid had no map!), it's a Classic Metroid fanboy's fantasy.  You even play as suitless Samus in a stealth mission, armed only with an automatic-charging pistol (this part is definitely one of the toughest parts in the game, since the pistol only stuns and the Space Pirates take off 100 HP when they touch you or shoot you).  The game even tells you where to go by using Chozo statues, making it much less frustration.  However, this is also a problem.  The game is easily beaten in 1-2 hours in one sitting due to the fact that you know where to go with the Chozo statues and the new weapons.  When you get to Tourian, the Metroids are easily destroyed, as opposed to how you drop off the elevator in the original and next thing you know 2 or 3 Metroids are sucking you bone dry, and you watch as your health just goes from full to 0 in 10 seconds.  Also the bosses are sissies (especially Ridley, who screeches like a little girl while you stand under him and bombard him with missiles.  Yes this is a strategy on how to easily beat Ridley), but I can't say the same for Mother Brain (who is actually far tougher than in the original), who actually uses energy waves to damage you alot this time.  But still, this is an excellent, fun to play remake of such a classic game.  Once you finish this game, you'll understand how the Metroid series has been classified as one of the greatest video game series of all time.\n",

      "I've already reviewed the Wii version of this game which I consider to be greatly inferior and falsely advertised as being superior to the GameCube version; so there's no need for me to repeat what I've already stated about the atrocious Wii Mote and Nunchuk controls. This version of the game has flawless controls thanks to the GameCube controller which some players regard as the best video game controller ever made. So I'm happy to finally review the GameCube version of this game. With that said, Twilight Princess is nowhere near a perfect game. This game has many, many glaring flaws which aren't as evident in previous Zelda titles. The most obvious being its complete lack of challenge.I can easily say this was without a doubt the easiest Zelda game when it was released and today it still remains the easiest Zelda game I've ever played, never played Skyward Sword nor do I want to. The enemies are pathetic. They pose absolutely no danger and no threat to Link whatsoever, especially the bosses which can easily be defeated the first time playing and without the loss of more than 5 hearts at most. The enemies found in Hyrule field are the most laughable and weak overworld enemies in video game history. They don't fight back and literally wait for you to kill them. Every single Zelda title before this game had challenging enemies and players were always in danger of losing hearts when in the presence of even a weak bat. In this game, the enemies don't fight back; you can kill scores of them with ease. Most of the enemies, after they've been attacked, are stunned for a few seconds giving you a great deal of time to finish them off. Bosses can easily be defeated with a minimal loss of hearts and figuring out their weaknesses has never been simpler than in this game since most of them have very obvious and cliched weak points such as the ever present eyeball and tail.A good scenario to use for comparison would be, imagine you were in a fight, the person you are fighting would delay each hit he makes by a few seconds giving you time to completely thrash him. Each time you hit him (and you can hit him multiple times rapidly), he pauses for a few seconds giving you even more time and an even greater advantage to completely annihilate him. That's exactly what playing Twilight Princess feels like, the enemies don't fight back and their speed can never ever compare to the speed of the player. If that doesn't make the game easy enough, you also have a shield. This shield doesn't have its own button and while using L to target an enemy, the shield is automatically drawn and remains present at all times during a fight; completely eliminating any possibility of the player ever taking a single hit in this entire game. Even flaming bats and fire arrows here bounce off the shield on your back. There's zero challenge whatsoever in this game. What you can do, is equip the wooden shield let it burn, and play through the game without a shield. This adds some challenge to the game and works for the most part. However, if I'm not mistaken, there may be some cut scenes which automatically equip a Hylian shield and you may have to buy another wooden shield, let it burn, and return to where you just were in order to play through the rest of the game with no shield. Just to add some challenge.As I played through the game, I kept waiting and waiting for the moment to come when I would finally face a challenging enemy worthy of my skills, but it never came. When playing through the Cave of Ordeals, I fought all the same enemies I faced in the rest of the game. Even the final enemies, the Darknuts were not difficult at all especially since I had the shield protecting me against 100% of their attacks. All you need to do is knock off their removable armor, hit them once and they become stunned allowing you to hit them continuously until they block you. After they've blocked you, manage to hit them again, repeat the process, and they're finished. There was no challenge anywhere in this game; the battle with Zant is so disappointing. And afterwards you enter Zelda's castle to experience the easiest Ganondorf battle in Zelda history and unfortunately a lot of this battle requires use of the wolf, instead of the sword like any other Zelda game. Why couldn't there have been an epic sword battle between Link and Ganondorf, two swords just like the teaser that eventually lead to WindWaker showed? Why instead did they have to come up with this ridiculous overdrawn ending fight? It's so childish. It's a complete disgrace to the battle from Ocarina of Time. Even the first time playing you'll take minimal damage. No enemy in this game is difficult; some of them can be annoying and tedious but not hard to beat.Years back I discovered some websites which contained Action Replay codes for this game. Some of these codes could be used to multiply the amount of health the enemies had. I used these particular codes thinking they would add some challenge to the game, but instead they only made battles much more annoying as now the enemies required way more hits to die and since they would never hit me back anyway, I was basically wasting time fighting a defenseless enemy that simply had more health than it originally would. Another code I tried was one that increased the damage dealt to Link when he would get hit by an enemy. This didn't make the game any more fun either, because now when I would occasionally get hit, I'd usually only be able to survive one more hit before dying and having to start all over. The game simply cannot be manipulated using codes to gain any positive results. The lack of challenge in this game is a programming issue on the part of the developers that intentionally made it easy for casual gamers and kids to play. Codes won't solve this mess.Another major let down was the false advertising from the game's trailers showing Link fighting hordes of Moblins that rode large wild boars. This event never happens in the game; instead you fight a mini boss riding a wild boar. The fight is very annoying because he can keep knocking you off your horse into Lake Hylia and afterwards (after losing a heart) you'll magically reappear on your horse ready for another attempt. It's really easy to win this fight because all you really have to do is charge a spin attack and you can hit this enemy each round. It's also very, very easy to lose this fight if you use any method other than the cheap shot spin attack. You know, like if you actually wanted to do a jousting battle with this guy, you'd lose each time so don't get your hopes up. You absolutely have to use a cheap spin attack to win even though it's physically impossible to do one in real life while riding horseback. Don't try to make this game feel realistic, you're wasting your time. Aside from this one fight, there's only 3 Moblins riding wild boars in one single part of Hyrule field and once you've defeated them they only re-spawn after you've left the screen. So no, there is no massive battle with an army of Moblins that ever happens in this easy game. That's called false advertising, why make a trailer of a beta when the official release will have such drastic changes?The wolf quests are unbelievably stupid and uninspired. As a wolf you go around sniffing out electric insects (from the ground or hiding in jars) which you kill to retrieve tear drops used to fill up a weird grape vine looking thing (that holds tear drops) given to you by a guardian light creature (based on one of the animals in the game) in any one of the fountains within each region of the game that uses the tear drops to restore light and remove the Twilight from that area. It's annoying and can take a very long time.I don't understand the game's use of Twilight creatures and how this could have possibly been considered fun. When you're in an area in the Twilight realm, suddenly this strange flying saucer looking thing appears in the sky and drops 3-4 alien looking monsters down to fight you. This is actually a portal from the game's Twilight realm and the aliens are Twilight monsters that must be KO'd simultaneously or else the last one alive will make a horrible shrieking noise that revives the fallen ones. You don't have to KO them all in one go, you just have to make sure that at least 2 are alive when you make your final hit killing both of them in one shot using Midna's targeting technique to target multiple enemies. They take one heart away each time they hit you and you can easily die if you're not careful. That doesn't make it challenging however, just annoying because you can't really tell when these enemies are going to make an attack. It's not clear because the graphics are convoluted in the Twilight realm and their attacks come suddenly.Some people actually have the audacity to compare the boring, tedious wolf quests to the sailing in Wind Waker which was actually fun, challenging, exciting, unique, had loads of treasures and new things for you to discover, and it was fun charting the many different islands in the game. The wolf quests on the other hand are simply used as filler material because the developers didn't want to take the time to develop something interesting and fun to do; so they have you waste time on boring bug killing/tear drop collecting quests like this. There weren't many mini games or extras in this game anyway even though the reviewers on IGN and Game Trailers said there was. Once you've beaten it, it's over and it's better to start over rather than run around Hyrule seeing all the same things you've already completed. I guess that's true about every game but this one in particular is very boring to play a save file you've already completed.You have two options for fishing in this game; one is using this mini rod you get in Ordon village. It's really easy to use and you can find either bee larva or worms to use as bait making the fish guaranteed catches. The camera view however is very awkward and you only know when you have a bite if this floating spike attached to the rod starts bobbing down into the water. At which point you simply pull the C Stick down until the fish is caught. The other option for fishing is the fishing pond which has been made more difficult than it was in Ocarina of Time, but that's okay. There's nothing wrong with some added challenge. After all the game needs to have a challenging aspect in it somewhere right? Might as well be here. For one thing, you use an assortment of different lures, each with its own unique technique for drawing in fish. Sometimes it can take forever to get the fish to come to you but that's kind of how it is in real life. If you're willing to pay the extra 100 rupees, you can have a \"lovely assistant\" sit in the boat with you. She doesn't do anything other than advise you on what spots are the best to fish in and she doesn't allow you to use a sinking lure in her presence, but it's nice to have the company of an attractive female rather than being alone. (Why doesn't Link ever have a girlfriend in these games? Why doesn't he ever kiss Zelda? Is Link, you know? I mean he does wear a skirt and in this game in particular, Link looks very effeminate? Way more than in previous Zelda games.) When the fish bite, it's not as simple as in Ocarina of Time where you hold the A and R buttons and pull down on the rod with the control stick. In this game, on screen indicators appear telling you which way to push or pull the rod. If the fish jumps push up on the C Stick, when it's in the water pull down, when it's close enough to you grab the fishing line with A to pull the fish out of the water. It's more realistic and challenging than Ocarina of Time and I actually kind of enjoyed this part of the game.With all that said, the game isn't all bad. The graphics are beautiful and the music in many places is serene and relaxing, except of course for the disgusting music for The City in The Sky. That song is so ugly and it never ever stops. It plays through both the inside and the outside of the temple, starting immediately after being shot from the cannon and landing in the water. It has annoying moans from these weird, creepy, hideous chicken like creatures that have human faces (Ooccas). The game is decent at best. I don't really like the whole Japanese aspect, the way female characters behave really frigid and repressed, and the way the other NPCs act is really strange and foreign to me. They make weird noises like \"wwwwwwoooooohhhhhh\", things that neither I nor anybody from the West could possibly understand or relate with.There are some annoying elements added to this game that weren't necessary and didn't appear in any other Zelda game before it. When you collect a rupee, if that rupee is any color other than green (worth 1 rupee), you will always get an annoying descriptive message about the type of rupee you just collected, similar to what happens when opening a treasure chest. It's completely unnecessary because we already know the amount the rupee contains based on its color due to our knowledge of previous Zelda games where this never occurred before. This means that every single time you turn off the game, the next time you turn it on the game is programmed to automatically display this annoying message once after collecting any non-green rupee (worth 1 rupee). There's no need for them to interrupt the gameplay like this, it's ridiculous and slows you down immensely. There actually is an Action Replay code to turn this message off and I always had this code enabled after discovering it. Hell yeah! Not only that, but after playing Wind Waker, you'll be deeply disappointed to find that the largest wallet in this game only allows you to carry a maximum of 1,000 rupees. Wind Waker's largest wallet allowed you to carry 5,000 rupees and that game was older. So there's no excuse especially since there are so many rupees in this game. Rupees are everywhere in this game, you need a bigger wallet. If you've reached an amount close to the maximum that your wallet holds, opening treasure chests with rupees will cause Link to put the rupees back in the chest. That's kind of annoying, especially since you're likely to never go back to that chest anyway. Just another example of them trying to fix something that wasn't broken.Chickens in this game will no longer attack you in swarms for stabbing at them, instead if you hit a chicken enough times you can actually take control of it for a few seconds. This serves no purpose and they spent time changing a feature that really didn't matter to begin with. Instead now it's the goats who will ram right into you as retaliation for you attacking them. I guess Nintendo's always tried to discourage animal abuse in their video games, except Pok&eacute;mon.In conclusion, this game is somewhat descent, but nowhere near as good as previous Zelda titles. Including WindWaker, which was far better. It's not a must have by any means and not very memorable. There was way too much anticipation for this game in the months preceding its release; I and many other long time Zelda fans expected much better than what we got. This game should've been released way earlier than December 2006. Nintendo could've easily made this game one of the first 50 GameCube launch titles but instead it was the very last game to be released for the console. Not to mention, we had to wait until a month after the release of the Wii version to finally play this on our GameCubes, even though they initially told us both versions would be released that same month of November. It wasn't that special when it came out and although the graphics and sound are quite good, it should've and easily could've been one of the first games to be released for the GameCube.\n",
      "When people think of Zelda, they're thinking one of two things: \"Oh boy, a new Zelda!\" or \"Oh boy. A new Zelda.\"  I found myself in the first camp as I anticipated what I thought would be a badass entry in my favorite series of games.  With Nintendo promising a more intricate overworld filled with puzzles that seamlessly flowed into dungeons, my mind raced, believing that the era of easy Zeldas designed with kids in mind was over.  What I got instead was a 40 hour fetchquest.I'll probably spoil some stuff so watch it.Also, I got the version with the bundled controller.The controller is nice, and not as fingerprint hungry as the others.Enemies in General:I'll be very blunt. There's about 4 enemies that you'll actually \"fight\" throughout the game. Bokoblins, Moblins, Stalfos, and Lizalfos.  They each come with different \"versions\" of themselves, basically reskinned and using a different weapon, for example the regular Lizalfos and the Dark Lizalfos. Regular ones shoot fire, Dark ones shoot \"cursed breath\" which induces the curse status, new to zelda, which leaves you unable to use weapons/items.  That's about it, aside from the bosses.  Combat is basically finding the obvious weakspot, hitting there, waiting for the enemy to move around aimlessly for a bit, opening the weakspot again, and striking again.  All other enemies are ohko.  But seriously, 70% of what you fight is just bokoblins, with moblins coming in around 7/8th's the way through the game. Every single Lizalfos I fought dropped a tail, and I have 12 of them. Not very many of those in comparison with the rest of the game.  There's beamos here and there, deku babas, and keese too.Dungeons and Bosses:The bosses are pretty fun. You fight Ghirahim three times throughout, the second fight being the most fun.  This fact makes it so that there are less bosses overall, however, as he is the boss of the first and sixth dungeon.  The fourth boss is very very fun, throwing attacks at you and continually getting back up to wreck you.  The fifth boss and fifth dungeon are probably the best in the game with the boss and the setting leading up to and during the fight being really great and immersive.  The boss is a giant Kraken thing with one eye. The dungeon is actually a ship, and once you finish the dungeon and prepare for the boss, it starts to rumble. Giant tentacles begin to tear through the entire ship, leading you back up to the deck.  As I said, this makes for a really cool moment that immerses you completely within the game.  The seventh (and final) dungeon has no boss battle.  The seventh dungeon is however one of the more difficult parts of the game, and it is very enjoyable.  The final boss is absolutely pathetic.The first three dungeons were beyond easy.  Getting inside them was tougher than the actual dungeons.  And getting inside them was basically just, dowse, dowse, dowse, ok now you have gathered X amount of things you need in order to get inside the dungeon which was extremely annoying. Dowsing has you basically moving around your sword in first person mode trying to pinpoint the location of something. Dowsing was originally showcased as a replacement to the compass, but you can't dowse inside dungeons. This continues to a lesser extent later on, but basically instead of exploring the game makes you waste time doing this.  There is not much to explore anyways, since the areas are extremely linear, as is the whole game.As an example, in the first area which is the woods, you have to find a bunch of Kikwis, which are the little tanooki looking creatures.  When you find them all, you go back to their boss which gives you the slingshot, which is required to enter the first dungeon.  Standard fare, but your first time doing this will undoubtedly take you longer than it should. It isn't as seamless as they said.  When they said that, I imagined the world suddenly takes you through an area and you find a chest with a key inside and you realize, woah, I'm in dungeon! I thought I was still just outside! Nope.Controls and Items:I found that in trying to strike quickly, the control would often flip out and do the wrong thing.  For example, if an enemy has an opening that calls for you to strike in a downward and to the right position, and you try to quickly do this motion, more than likely you won't be hitting it correctly, resulting in the enemy parrying or your attack bouncing off and then getting hit, as you leave yourself open.  This was with the actual control that game with the game, not a wii remote + attachment.  When done in a slow motion, it is accurate. So you have to wave gently in order to perform an attack. Doesn't really feel like I'm attacking something.  1:1? I don't think Nintendo knows what that means.  Additionally, it is laggy. It will not perform the movement the instant you do it unless you're moving slowly.  I tested this between 60Hz and 120Hz, and it was definitely worse on the 60Hz (obviously).Flying and swimming are handled in the same manner, by holding the wii remote horizontally and adjusting direction by tilting and twisting.  Some may like this, some may not.  I enjoyed flying and swimming, but it became a bit cumbersome with the laggy response time.The shield mechanic is pretty solid.  You use the nunchuk to throw up your shield to reflect attacks, which normally gives you the chance to counterattack.  If you fail to perform it correctly though, it takes a chunk out of your shield's \"life bar\" which eventually leads to it breaking.  The shield can be upgraded, but it is sort of pointless seeing as you get the chance to buy an improved shield every time you feel like upgrading it.Your other items work pretty spot on, even allowing you to recenter the aim with a press of down on the D-PAD. They all felt good to use, even though they didn't get too much use aside from the beetle.  The Bow and Arrows are the last item you get making it a bit strange that you can't use them to fight much through out the game.  I hardly used anything but the sword as a fighting weapon where as in previous zelda games I'd use almost everything but the sword.  The items are more spread out as well.  Items that we saw like the digging mitts are only useable in specific areas and are not assigned to your item wheel, but instead an equipped item, like a tunic would have been equipped in Ocarina of Time.  Your shield and bottles and nonessential items are stored in a secondary item wheel.  This can be seen as useful or not.  This is just a matter of personal opinion as I'm sure not everyone liked the huge item wheel from Twilight Princess.  This secondary item wheel can only carry four items initially, and must be upgraded by buying more pouches from Beedle in a majorly escalating price point.  The bomb bag and arrow quiver cannot be upgraded, but instead you can buy additional bags or quivers which hold an extra 5 units a piece.  These must go in your secondary item wheel, which can dissuade you from wanting them in the first place.  The game never leaves you without a patch of bomb flowers if you need them or without arrows if you cut the grass.  This same mechanic applies to the ignored slingshot.Plot:The majority of the time, when you get to an interesting plot point, you have to begin another fetch quest.  The biggest of these isSPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERSthe forging of the Master Sword.  This negative point can be attributed to simple fanboy nerdrage, but let's examine it anyways.  In prior Zelda games it is said that the Master Sword is a relic of the ancient Hylians, forged by sages as the blade of evil's bane.  In this game, it is originally called the Goddess Sword, that the goddess Hylia creates in an intricate plot to destroy the game's main villain who gets mentioned about once throughout the game until the very end.  Link has to, in a similar fashion to the also not very good Phantom Hourglass, gather 3 of something in order to turn the Goddess Sword into the Master Sword.  Once you do create it, you get an anti climatic \"MASTER LINK, YOU NOW HOLD THE MASTER SWORD.\" from Fi.  The creation of the Master Sword is retconned, and it is made in a way copied from PH.  Cool. Not. This also implies that the people in skyloft are not the Hylians in question from before, as there were people on the surface prior to them.The game also does not explain anything about the hylian crest (the red bird and the triforce) that is present on the shields.  You get the Hylian Shield in the game, with no mention of Hyrule or anything of the sort, but you see the emblem sans the head of the bird and the triforce all over the place though.As for characters, I didn't delve too deeply into the sidequests as I wasn't expecting a second helping of Majora's Mask. The game lets you court several of the female NPC's apparently though. Tsk tsk, cheating on zelda? Shame on you.  You get the standard serving of Zelda people with repeated dialogue and grunts with some comedy here and there, (mostly from Groose).Conclusion:Yes, I understand that all Zelda is is basically a fetchquest.  Going through three dungeons to get the Master Sword is nothing new.Going through three dungeons to FORGE the Master Sword is a problem, to me anyway.I can't really continue with this as it's basically all that needs to be said about this game.Is it worth the money?  Not really.  From what I've seen people are split and either love it or dislike it.The game's length is artificially extended.I'll probably get flamed for writing a negative review of it, but people, I've been making bacon bits out of Ganon since I was four.For me, this is the Other M of the Zelda series and a sign that maybe Nintendo isn't going to be pumping out stuff like it used to.Maybe Groose was right. Maybe it should have been called \"The Legend of Groose.\"\n",
      "Illusion of Gaia made the list of top 100 games in Nintendo Power's Volume 100, and understandably so.  Definitely a decent game, Illusion of Gaia has much to offer, including some very nice environments with crisp graphics, better than the likes of Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past.  It can be very fun to play, and it is even somewhat educational since many of its dungeons are based on real places.  To speak more about the graphics, the monster design is nearly flawless.  Every dungeon has different monsters with different looks and attacks, and even the residents of each town look completely distinct from those of the previous town or the next town, something that not even the SNES Final Fantasy games managed to do.  These details all add up to a visually pleasing game.  The necessity to kill all the enemies in each area in order to upgrade is also a positive element of the game because it gives a sense of accomplishment in each room.  Though in spite of these positive elements, Illusion of Gaia should not be called a Zelda killer.  It is also very different from Zelda in certain ways and therefore can not be compared in all aspects to Zelda.Although there is a myriad of items in Illusion of Gaia, their usage demonstrates one of the principle differences between Zelda and Illusion of Gaia.  Most of the items in Illusion of Gaia are keys, puzzle pieces, or other objects that get used once in a specific location and then leave your inventory.  It is not difficult to find where to use acquired items, but a few of them can be difficult to find since they are not all found in treasure chests.  Players should not expect all the different weapons and devices such as those seen in Zelda a Link to the Past.  Will, the game's protagonist, uses a flute for a weapon.  Zelda purists may mock this, but Will's flute is by no means the only weapon in the game.  Will learns interesting techniques and also has the ability to morph into different entities during the quest who also acquire their own techniques.  Illusion of Gaia may not have quite as many puzzles as a Link to the Past, but it certainly has its decent fill, and the whole style of the puzzles is different.  Perhaps the puzzles at the end of the Angel Village come to mind as the most different from anything seen in Zelda.  Nonetheless, the mainstream of the game remains arguably more in fighting than thinking.  Some of the dungeons could have used more puzzles and items, but most are not so lacking that they create any feelings that something is missing.The main problem with Illusion of Gaia is that it rapidly starts to fall apart in the middle, both in terms of story and game progression.  I pinpoint this turn of events around the Great Wall of China, but by no means say that the story is perfect up to then because it is not.  The difference is that earlier in the game enough goes on to overshadow inconsistencies and holes.  Later in the game, in addition to the story deteriorating, the blandness of the world layout becomes much more noticeable as well, making the travel less interesting.  Aside from the Tower of Babel's circular island in the center of the world, Illusion of Gaia's world map consists mainly of three continents.  Two of them basically fill the southeast and southwest corners of the world, and one long continent north of the Tower of Babel island stretches horizontally across the whole map.  The game starts on one of the bottom continents and gradually progresses to the long northern continent, where the Great Wall of China comes early.  Travel at this point just becomes a bland pattern of the group arriving at a town, Will leaving to go to a dungeon alone, Will returning to the town, and then the group going on to the next town.  It is more varied earlier in the game during which there is usually another thing to do or a person to visit between a town and big dungeon, and these events add flow to the story.  Later in the game some of the group's members start to leave and there is nothing to break up the dull pattern.  Some of the reasons for going to the later dungeons are also extremely vague and not well supported in the overall story.  Example, why exactly does Will go to Mt. Temple and Angkor Wat?  There is no dialogue or story saying that anything specifically needs to be done in these places.  In the other dungeons the story makes it clear if you have to go to a specific dungeon and why, but with later dungeons like Mt. Temple and Angkor Wat, all that happens is that someone will point out or draw a picture of something on Will's map.  What is even more puzzling about these two dungeons is why the game makes you walk all the way back out of them after getting the item at the end.  There was absolutely no reason for this to have happened.  It did not happen with any of the other dungeons, and it should not have happened with these two.  The least they could have done was at the end of Angkor Wat transport you back to the entrance after the white light faded.  It would have made perfect sense, and I can even picture the text box \"When the light was gone I found myself at the temple entrance ...\" Whatever... but another thing to rip regarding these dungeons and this general point in the game is that given the time it supposedly takes for Will to travel to some of these later dungeons, none of the companions ever ask Will where he went or why he left them in the town without saying anything.  Example, as soon as Will arrives at Angkor Wat, a text box says that it took him three days to get there from the Native's Village.  After Will returns to the Native's Village neither Kara nor Erik asks him where he's been for the last week (which is how long we can assume it took for him to get to the temple, explore it, and return) or why he left them in the Native's Village.  This is either a rushed part of the game or lack of thinking on the part of the writers.  Yes the earlier stages of the story have similar issues that are not quite addressed, but again; earlier in the game enough happens to make the players forget or pardon these instances.  Since not much interesting occurs later in the game, the holes in the plot really wear on.The vagueness surrounding later dungeons is far from the only weakness in the story (specific story spoilers ahead until last paragraph, only warning).  Many fundamental questions are never answered or explained.  Will had lost his father a year prior to the current events and starts the game living with his grandparents.  He, his father, and apparently many others had gone on an expedition to the Tower of Babel and somehow only Will made it back, of course not remembering what happened or how he made it back.  At no point is it ever explained what exactly happened or how Will made it back to South Cape.  Will's father at the end tells him about a \"strange room in the tower where time passes so quickly that people evolve quickly.\"  Is this supposed to mean that Will's father went into this room, aged so fast and died instantly?  How exactly did Will get his telekinetic power??  Will's father tells him that he and Kara are evolved humans.  What exactly is that supposed to mean?  How and why are they evolved?  Are they evolved and no one else?  Is it because Will is a descendent of Dark Knights?  How exactly are they different from other humans if they are evolved?  Will's mother also appears in a dream and as a ghost, but it is never explained how she died!!  Was she also on the expedition to the Tower of Babel??  It remains a mystery.  If these fundamental questions had been satisfactorily explained, some of the other problems might have been more pardonable.  If the writers had any idea how to make a decent story, they would have answered these questions and devoted more of the story to the ancients as well.If I were to ever reward a game for worst ending ever Illusion of Gaia is undoubtedly the recipient.  I absolutely hate the ending to this game.  What started with seemingly endless potential finished going virtually nowhere.  Basically you beat the comet and oh all of the sudden the world changes to present day Earth.  What??  And it finishes in a SCHOOL??  With Will and friends wearing sweatshirts and school backpacks???!!!  Are you kidding me??!  This ending makes NO SENSE WHATSOEVER, and is totally PATHETIC!!  Here's a SMALL list of all the things the ending did not answer or settle:1) Did time just fast forward or something?  It takes a long time for continents to shift and for buildings to get built.  They DON'T JUST APPEAR DURING AN ENDING OF A SUPER NINTENDO GAME!!2) Do any of the characters remember the journey?  Are they reincarnated?  Are they the same people as they were before?3) Did non-humans go extinct?  What happened to the Angel Village people?  I also didn't see Lilly in the school shot.  Did Itory Village people just die out?4) Kara never made up with her parents.  For all we know the teapot on Mt. Temple might have shown them to be spirits too.5) Did Lance's parents ever get reunited?6) Did the labor trade ever get stopped?  How did Neil do as company president?7) Just what exact age was the time during the game supposed to be?  The new world with gray buildings and presumably technology is deemed by Will to be strange in the premonition, but Neil can build an airplane during the game??8) What ended up happening to Bill and Lola?  Did they die?  Did they just forget about Will?9) Does Will keep his telekinetic powers?I cringe when I think of what Illusion of Gaia could have been, and wish I could tell the writers what morons they were when they wrote the story to this game.  It is still a solid game, but if the world design and story had been better, the game would have reached unimaginable heights.  You don't just leave things unsettled, change the world, and think everyone's going to be happy.  For a game of this genre that is not Zelda and is not plagued with Illusion of Gaia's problems, play Crystalis.\n",

Did they just forget about Will?9) Does Will keep his telekinetic powers?I cringe when I think of what Illusion of Gaia could have been, and wish I could tell the writers what morons they were when they wrote the story to this game.  It is still a solid game, but if the world design and story had been better, the game would have reached unimaginable heights.  You don't just leave things unsettled, change the world, and think everyone's going to be happy.  For a game of this genre that is not Zelda and is not plagued with Illusion of Gaia's problems, play Crystalis.\n",
      "As one of those pitiable, old souls who played Pokemon when it was first released, back in the days of Gameboy, I've participated in every single rendition of the Pokemon RPG series, Red, Blue, Yellow, Gold, Silver, Platinum, Ruby, Sapphire, Crystal, Fire Red, Leaf Green, Diamond, Pearl, Heart Gold, Soul Silver, Black, White, and now this: Pokemon Black 2.I do suppose you have to ask exactly what this is. Each rendition of Pokemon usually gets a name, and seeing as though GRAY might have been the color chosen, I can see why a sequel was instead used. But, again, what IS this game? Why does it exist? Is it better than Black or White? Is it truly a sequel? Is it worth getting for full price?Well, no.You see, the same answer should be said for all of the \"Sequels\" in the series bar the remakes, in that the same world, the story doesn't change all that much and basically, you'd get pretty much the same level of entertainment, with a few extras, playing what is basically an EXPANSION, for the cost of the full game. Black and White 2 are no different in this regard.Black and White 2 take place 2 years after the events of Black and White, if you haven't played the first game, don't worry though because the previous plot is not necessary to be known to enjoy the game, however, it does provide background that will add to B/W 2's plot. In this instance, you and your rival once again take on the baddies, and amass a team of super powered creatures to wage battle to save the world, and become the champion of Unova, and collect data on all the Pokemon ever.So what's wrong here? Quite simply, the game isn't fresh, it doesn't have the steam that its predecessors have, and that's due, in part to a few new problems the newer versions have.First of all the newer versions of the game like to get excessively lost in the storyline, now, this isn't so much an issue with some as it is with me, personally reading 10-20 minute monologues is tedious, and because nothing in Pokemon is ever actually \"said\" the developers constantly having you read a small novel whenever any kind of interactivity with NPCs is on the screen relating to the story is actually pretty boring. Sit down and read read read, with the occasional, step or something happening. The addition of the Xtrancseiver Has not aided this, and now many plot points come in through telephone calls that are often very inconsequential, and I'll admit annoying. Being able to see the character does not make it entertaining, this is in sharp contrast to the phone in previous games where you could pretty much ignore calls. I also think the tutorial steps in the games has gotten close to a lunatic level, everything must be explained, at length. Seriously, Gamefreak, give us our Teachy TV back , if we want tutorials we'll go there. There is simply no reason to stall a new game for an hour while you're forced to fumble about doing mundane stuff you've done in the previous games a thousand times in order to earn silence. Seriously, give us our running shoes, our stuff, and a lv 7 version of whatever we've chosen and start us off in front of our house with the tutorial crap out of the way. All it takes is an option in the start up menu after naming your avatar.The problem is that the main fanbase is returning again and again to be told the same thing, and its tedious, and unneccesary.The second problem is this generation's Pokemon, with the exception of a few, This might be the biggest set of uninspired nonsense so far, with Pokemon like Trubbish, Patrat, Woobat, and Vanillite to utter a few, combined with that, the weakest starters ever return in this game, with literally all three starters failing to capture even a tiny fragment of the magic the first few games hold. I can't explain how much more difficult this makes playing the game, since you won't run into pretty much ANY of the types the starters offer within the first few towns worth anything, and since the starters are so lame, you'll want to replace your \"special\" starter pokemon, almost instantly. Tepig is let's face it, a Pig, and therefore, however awesome his evolutions become, isn't all that good, but believe it or not is likely the best option, as Snivy has almost no potency or moves and is outclassed by gross number of grass types, and Oshawott is simply tragic due to his evolution and abysmal, well, everything. Of course this is an opinion, but do not expect any sort of metagame use like that of Charizard, Typhlosion, or even Blaziken from any of the new contenders, once again cementing use of previous pokemon created over ten years ago as the stuff people flock to. And this is surprisingly where Black 2 stands out from Black. Pokemon in Unova have been modified to include some of the other 600+ rather than just the Unovan-dex like in Black and White. While there just aren't enough good ones early on to make a team you'll stick with, this is par the course for Pokemon and through the game you'll have many opportunities to refine your team into a respectable crew of soldiers with which to do battle.Unfortunately save Black and White 2's additions to the Pokemon in Unova, and the inclusion of more interesting characters, it still feels more deja-vu than anything, the locations haven't changed much, and the ones that have aren't explored long enough to have memorable value, and so the game comes down with a case of repetition and thanks to its over exuberant use of monologue and tutorials, it REALLY drags through the beginning, hitting a height somewhere before the final, then completely falling flat again into the metagame, where there is surprisingly little to do. There are  a few extra towns you visited in Black and White, but nothing new, and the ability to get some ubers. Finally there is the Elite Four again and that's pretty much it.Nintendo WFC has gotten minor upgrades, but there isn't much to write home about, but online remains a steady, difficult set of powerful trainers and stingy traders, and while Nintendo have made trading easier, a search function would have been far more useful in trades if we could search by words we put in ourselves, I can't look up pokemon unless I've seen them, which means I can't trade for them unless I can see them in my game (since the search uses the PKMN field which is tied to your pokedex) So to reiterate, online is very good, but still has a long way to go, and for GOD'S SAKE GET RID OF FRIEND CODES.Black 2 and White 2 are great games, and are much better if you HAVEN'T played either Black 1 or White 1. Even if you have played those titles they're good games, they're free of bugs for the most part, and all of the things in the game are clear, easy to use and the series has refined the battle system to such an extent, I can't find a single hole in it. The story of Black 2, which is more mundane than that of the first game, the rival, who is much more relatable, doesn't do a good enough job to bring you BACK to Unova. The Starters still stink, much of the Unova Brood is rather pointless and you'll readily find yourself passing them by in favor of the injected oldies. The game simply talks too much and doesn't get going quick enough and when it does, it can't keep it up too long. Finally and most importantly, the Metagame is far too undeveloped, and most of the activities can be completed in a couple of hours, unlike Gold and Silver which had an ENTIRE SEPARATE REGION to explore after the first. The problem is everything comes to a head, and just finishes up all at once, leaving a few straggling things to do and only a few new places to explore. The thing is, Black 2 still feels like an expansion, not a new game, but it's far too insistent on pushing its story, which is not progressive, and only mildly interesting. There are times in the story where the game comes to a complete halt and you won't know why, forcing you to do something somewhere that wasn't communicated very well. The final nail in the coffin is how easy it is, there is practically no challenge to be had, your creatures will decimate almost anything, the game doesn't even really get hard into the metagame, with powerful trainers you'll easily take down included. Nothing stands out like the Red battle from Gold and Silver, the boosted elite fours of old, or even some metagame content in Black or White. Black 2 is a Pokemon game, but it's a bit of a bore to drag yourself through, it is an ok game, but it's hard for me to recommend.\n",
      "I'm assuming that anyone viewing this is buying just Wii Fit Plus, without the board, and so am evaluating this as an upgrade to the original. I was so excited to get this upgrade as I was a fan of the Wii Fit from the time it came out, but it's since been put in the closet in favor of other exercise games (my current favorite being the Gold's Gym Shape Boxing). So I had high hopes for this, particularly after getting the awesome Wii Sports Resort. But I'm not as thrilled with this as other users. Since the pluses have been pretty well covered by others, I'll just mention my gripes with the game (I definitely like the improvements, but those are well advertised and mentioned numerous times by other reviewers so will just save you the hassle of reading all about them again).First, it gives you 15 new games but they all appear on their own screen, rather than incorporated into the balance and aerobic games panels so you have to kind of remember which are which (and I guess some aren't really either). Couldn't they have just spent a little time reorganizing things rather than this obviously \"added on\" kind of screen? I also continue to be frustrated with the lack of accuracy. Things like the math game where you have to bump your hips in certain directions, it constantly is reading me incorrectly, which particularly in that game really messes things up. Likewise trying to aim in the snowball fight was an exercise in getting a Wii remote to work properly. The games that require stepping onto the board in time with the music continue to baffle me, I've yet to determine what will get it to register good scores on these no matter how perfectly I seem to be on the beat. Kids in particular it often has trouble with (we are guessing this is due to their considerably lighter weight), and when we've played with other people, they always seem to have issues with some action or another. They'll suddenly stop running or jumping in the middle of the obstacle course for instance, and much swearing will ensue. It's not for lack of practice, the game just behaves really flaky. I've played other similar games (like the aforementioned shape boxing) that are not nearly as bad at registering my movements, and so this continues to frustrate me. After having experienced how much better it can be in Sports Resort with the motion plus, I just had to keep reminding myself it's not all about getting higher scores, but getting some exercise. Hard for my competitive nature though, when things keep going so off kilter.The new games are a mixed bag for me. There are a few I enjoy, most underwhelmed me considerably. I really wanted to see a lot more stuff that is *exercise* in this version, but seems most of the aerobic type games involve running in place on the board (the flapping game being the exception). This is a big issue for me as I had a bad knee and cannot run for long on such a hard, high-impact surface. Otherwise, it seems a lot of the new games are more balance games, that really aren't much, if any, exercise. Bumping your hips to do math and throwing snowballs is all very fun, but I have plenty of other Wii games to have fun with. Some of the games we really like...they just aren't much exercise (Tilt City and Juggling for instance). Granted the Wii Fit has always been only light exercise, but I really hoped to get more that really got me moving....in different kinds of ways. I also would have liked to see more of the games just with extended times, so you aren't constantly exercising for 2-4 minutes and then stopping to start the game again. Would it really have been that hard to do another, longer level for the stepping or boxing or even the newer games like skateboarding? This continues to be a major issue with the Wii Fit, and doesn't seem like it would have been that hard to address. On the flip side, I wonder about some of these games and how appropriate they are to do for any amount of time. When I've played the chicken game at more advanced levels for instance, I often have shoulder pain from all the flapping...not a real normal arm motion for most people. The game can pressure you into pushing to do these motions at higher speeds that is appropriate, so use caution particularly with children...or us older folks that don't know when to quit either! It's also not hard on some of these games to get running fast enough to lose track of your place on the board and misstep on the edge. Overall, when compared with other exercise programs out there now, it just really doesn't have that much for even a half-decent aerobic workout, and I've since come to appreciate games that don't require dragging out the Wii Fit board, and that I can do on a yoga mat and/or with shoes on to reduce the impact issues, and that do the exercise(s) at a strictly controlled speed and intensity to reduce chance of injury.Another issue for me was that the custom workouts only use the strength and yoga training. Due to the physical issues I have (and limited space), very few of these are doable for me, so the balance and aerobic exercises are what I want to do most of the time. Likewise with the kids I know, these are what they want to spend their time on. I was so frustrated to find that I am still having to spend 50% of my time navigating around and don't have a way to line up a bunch of games and just play them straight through like I was expecting. Considering the issue with the short length of the games, this is a real issue that should have not been overlooked. Another thing that drives us a little batty is all the screens you have to click through with each new player. We do *love* the new feature to switch to another Mii and play as a guest, but when you do this, it won't unlock new levels for that player, or track their Fit credits. There really needs to be a SKIP feature for all those screens that none of us read anyway. The Fit Plus seems to have even more of them.Overall, I am glad to have some new games to play with it, and for anyone that is new to the Wii Fit, it's got a lot of worthwhile improvements over the original such that there's no reason to buy the original over this one. And if you still regularly use your Wii Fit, there's enough improvements and new features and games that you will definitely want to consider getting this. For those of us that have gotten tired of it and moved onto other, better exercise programs I don't think this is going to bring enough to the table to get that board out of the closet for long. The new games are fun and being able to create your own list of yoga and strength exercises is a nice touch and may keep you entertained for a short while, but overall I was disappointed with the lack of growth in terms of this providing a decent everyday workout. But for $20 or less, it still may be worth considering, not necessarily as an exercise program, but for a batch of pretty fun games. I would still love to see a Fit Plus Plus that addresses some of these issues though. It also would be nice to see a Wii Fit Kids that has games of easier skill level for younger children. A lot of these games are pretty challenging for kids to get through even at Beginner level (heck, even the adults needed a LOT of attempts to conquer the beginner obstacle course levels). It also tends to give \"overweight\" messages to kids that are of perfectly normal weights for their age...not a message that they need in this overly-image sensitive time!\n",
      "I'm a longtime fan of the traditional pokemon games (like Pokemon Pearl and Diamond), so when I saw this spin-off, I was pretty excited.  Unfortunately, it took me a long time to actually get around to playing this game (various reasons I won't go into).  It seems with Pokemon Ranger that they were looking to emphasize the RPG gameplay a bit more than the monster-raising aspects.  Well, I was excited to play this, but unfortunately, I wasn't able to finish the game.  I normally do not write reviews for games I haven't finished, but I feel I need to write a review on this to warn people who may be unable to finish for the same reason I did.  Just check the gameplay section for those details...  Since I got roughly half-way through the game, every other category's judgment is based on that experience.Graphics (score 7/10): Graphics aren't too bad at all.  In fact, they look better than the traditional Pokemon games, even the most recent Pokemon Black and White.  The character models are just more detailed looking and actually have more animations.  Compared to games on the DS in general, the graphics are pretty average looking; nothing too special but also nothing bad.Music (score 7/10): Once again, \"average\" is the word of choice I'd use to describe this category.  The music is pretty standard fare for anyone who's familiar with Pokemon games.  It's just simple, but pleasant, ambient RPG-esque tunes.  Nothing irritating, but nothing that stands out too much either.Characters (score 7/10): Well, as is par for the course for Pokemon games, the characters are pretty simplistic.  You have your ubiquitous \"Professor\" character, and several NPCs.  You can choose which gender you prefer to be, but either way, your protagonist doesn't have much personality.  The rest of the characters have a bit more personality, but not much compared to real RPGs.  Of course, the pokemon series was always aimed at children, and as such, have pretty simple characters, so I can't really mark off too many points in this category.Story (score 7/10): Well, I've only managed to experience half of the story, but I've played all the traditional pokemon games so I already know what to expect.  Basically, it's the same old formula with your protagonist, a criminal organization (the Go-Rock Squad) who's hilariously incompetent, themes of friendship with pokemon, etc.  The story is moved forward by going on missions.  Basically, you are a new Ranger and the Ranger Station just gives you missions to complete.  These missions will consist of something like \"go into the forest and rescue a lost person\".  Once you finish one mission, the story moves forward and you get another mission.  That's about it.  The story is sub-par compared to the average RPG, but for a pokemon game, it's pretty average.Gameplay (score 4/10): This is a bit of a catch-all category for me.  Well, here it is - the category that made me stop playing the game.  This pokemon game differs from the traditional ones in a major way - there are no turn-based battles.  Instead, you can capture \"friend\" pokemon using the stylus by drawing loops around them on the touchscreen.  You also don't get to keep any of the pokemon that you capture.  They stay temporarily as you work on missions and leave once the mission is done.  You'll also need to capture certain pokemon to clear environmental obstacles (like using a cyndaquil to burn a log blocking your path).  As for the stylus capturing method, this is really what got me.  At first, it wasn't bad at all.  In fact, I thought the new gameplay mechanic was fresh and interesting.  However, as soon as I got to the section with the Jungle Relic and the trials, the difficulty spikes immensely.  I really was caught off guard.  You can't use any friend pokemon to help you in here, leaving you with only your partner pokemon who's completely ineffectual for these difficult captures.  I've tried about twenty times, and I just can't do it.  I even went seeking some FAQs to see if there was some great technique I was missing or something, but they all just said things like \"be fast and good luck\".  Yeah, thanks for that.  I physically cannot go any faster, and I'm afraid to just go crazy with the thing anyways lest I scratch my lovely DS screen.  I've had the thing for five whole years now and there isn't a single scratch on the screen, and I'll be darned if I cause one now!  I'll be honest here, maybe I'm just a crappy gamer and that's why I can't do it.  I've primarily been a connoisseur of turn-based RPGs and point-and-click adventure games up to this point since I just don't have good reflexes.  While I have a large number of games in my collection and count myself a serious gamer (I've finished and reviewed over sixty games), I just can't play certain types of games.  Normally I'd just chalk up this game as not being bad in and of itself, but just too hard for me.  No hard feelings and such.  However, this game is specifically aimed towards kids.  I feel that the difficulty level is unfair for them regardless of whether I can finish the game or not.  Not to mention, even if it didn't get so difficult, the gameplay would soon grow pretty stale and repetitive since it's a simple mechanic without much depth to it.Overall (score 4/10): NOTE this score is not an average; it's my subjective overall score.  I don't normally dock a game score this low when there's not much wrong with it, but being unable to finish a game really detracts for me.  Plus, I really just can't recommend this game to anyone.  Kids are quickly going to get frustrated with it's difficulty, and fans of the deep battle mechanics from the other pokemon games are not going to find much here to satisfy them.  The storyline isn't going to win any awards, and the gameplay (even if it isn't too hard for you) is just repetitive and tedious.  I find myself unable to really recommend this to anyone.  If you are a long-time fan of the pokemon franchise, just play Black and White until a new generation comes out and skip Pokemon Ranger altogether.  If you are new to pokemon, definitely don't start with this game.  Try one of the more traditional pokemon games; you'll have much more enjoyable gameplay that will give you a much deeper, more cerebral experience as you plan teams and battle strategies and such.  Just pick up Pokemon Black, White, Pearl, Diamond, Platinum, Heart Gold, or Soul Silver instead of this spin-off.  I guarantee one of those will bring you a much more fulfilling experience than Pokemon Ranger would.\n",
      "The Good:+You can play as a Pokemon and not a trainer+Constructing your own Pokemon paradise is quite fun+There will be plenty of missions for the player to achieve, both optional and story driven+Very graphically and musically sound gameThe Bad:-The game is pretty wordy, more so than most RPGs out there; the fact that you can't skip through or speed up the text means it'll get in the way of gameplay more than it should-The randomly generated floors can be pretty monotonous and boring after a while-Your AI controlled partners are pretty poor in combat-If any of your AI controlled partners fails while wandering on their own then it counts as a loss for the whole partyPokemon Mystery Dungeon has been Pokemon's foray into the dungeon crawling experience for years.  The reaction to it, however, has often been very mixed.  In this day and age especially, it's hard to make a dungeon crawling game that really stands out.  Pokemon Mystery Dungeon is a game that could've easily been so much better than it is.  There are a few hook ups that keep the experience from being an awesome one.  Certainly a Die-Hard Pokemon fan can (and probably will) appreciate it, but in the long run it's hard to tell people to shell out money for an experience that might get old pretty fast.As you can imagine, because it's Pokemon the story is a pretty simple affair.  You are a trainer that wakes up from a nightmare as a Pokemon.  And once in this new world you will discover that there are nothing but Pokemon abound.  There isn't a single trainer in sight.  In this world, your goal is to help to build a Pokemon Paradise.  Other Pokemon places have become corrupt by greed and violence, however and it's up to you and your allies to restore order in the land.  You'll accept quests and explore dungeons to reap the rewards and hopefully earn the respect of your peers.  Pokemon Mystery Dungeon (or rather Pokemon in general) has never had a really deep story.  They're usually about gameplay.  It's a little strange then that for such a simple premise, Pokemon Mystery Dungeon has so much to say.  You can't bypass through much of the dialog or increase the rate at which the characters speak.  You won't mind this at first, but it soon becomes annoying when you're simply trying to progress to the next dungeon.  As an RPG like game it probably should be a little wordy, but as a dungeon crawler it also needs to get to the point swiftly.Like previous Pokemon Mystery Dungeon experiences you'll go into dungeons that are randomly generated and explore.  Upon completion you'll get some loot and usually a reward.  Much of the loot that you find can be used to help construct your paradise and that's not so bad.  On the other hand, the dungeons are never really all that creative.  They're almost always very straightforward.  And while you'll be able to take in a team and find items, a lot of the time the dungeons are just boring to traverse.  There isn't a lot of detail to the environments.  But what really can make it painful is to battle with your AI party.  Pokemon Mystery Dungeon can be a challenge, but not because you yourself are that particularly bad at it, mostly it'll be because of the frustration of dealing with your AI controlled allies who will sometimes use the worst attacks at the worst time and never really learn from their experience.  They'll spam the same attacks constantly.  They can be more of a hindrance than anything.  And despite all that, the game is still a relatively simple experience.  If the worst should happen to you in any dungeon the punishment isn't really all that severe.  You can also just go right back in and try again.  And if you die too many times eventually the dungeon will just maintain a certain layout so that you can actually get through it just by recognizing stuff.The AI is going to be a hindrance in more ways than one, however.  Since you can split up your team and they can run off without you, you may find that they'll bite the dust a couple of times.  This wouldn't be much of a bothersome thing... except for if one person in your party goes down the whole team stands to lose as a result.  You can give up, if you wish, or you can wait to be rescued.  But waiting to be rescued often entails that you utilize the 3DS's street pass and hope that you walk by someone who wants to rescue you (or team up with a friend).  In most cases you might as well give up, but what makes it so annoying is that, once more, it could be a loss suffered by no action of the player at all.  And often times when your AI companions are defeated it's by a pretty weak foe.  You're better off trying to stick together with your entire party.Chances are you may have to enter and reenter a dungeon a few times, though.  As with many dungeon crawlers, grinding is pretty important.  Since you have limited use of techniques you may sometimes run out of the more useful ones before you actually get to the end.  So you may have to exit and re-enter.  The good news is that your levels don't reset.  Your techniques also become better with use.  So if you fail a dungeon or need to leave, you can always come back stronger.  Eventually (just through the process of grinding) you'll be good enough to complete a dungeon.In the past, most of the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon games have looked pretty similar to a Gameboy Advance game.  Not necessarily a bad thing as they were still colorful and artful.  Here they up the ante and the game looks pretty darn good.  It has a nice cartoon like look to it that really brings out the detail in the game.  As you construct your Pokemon Paradise it looks even better.  As a long term goal, watching your Paradise grow may be enough motivation to keep playing.  The graphical presentation doesn't do it justice in the dungeons, though.  While the dungeons are pretty they eventually become quite bland.  There just isn't a lot of a variety and detail in a lot of them.  But at the very least the Pokemon themselves look very good.  The graphical presentation might not be enough to save it from how monotonous the game can feel at times, however.  The overall presentation of the game is pretty solid overall.  The sprites and character designs are charming and the music isn't half bad either.  On a technical level, Gates to Infinity is a pretty good looking and good sounding game.Overall, it takes a real die hard fan of the series to truly love Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Gates to Infinity.  There is something about that can be compelling to keep you going, but for those who really want a Pokemon fix it may just be better to wait on Pokemon X and Y to get here.\n",
      "Pokemon Battle Revolution is anything but a revolution.  It feels like a step in the wrong directions sometimes.  Mostly, however, you just feel like the game wasn't complete... like it could use a lot more than we got.  Simply put, Battle Revolutions isn't bad, it's just a glass that's half full.  This is a game for only the most die-hard of Pokemon fans only.Let's get the first big annoying thing out of the way.  If you don't have Pokemon Diamond or Pearl, then I highly suggest buying those before you actually dive into this game.  Otherwise you'll find your experience to be a pretty daunting one.  If you don't, you get passes with random Pokemon on them.  This is pretty sad considering other Pokemon games in this genre let you rent Pokemon.  Instead here, you're given six random Pokemon with random stats and moves.  You've no say in the matter, and that's just lame.  At least transferring your Pokemon from your DS games is no pain at all.Let's get the second really annoying thing out of the way.  The menu is alright and everything, but your guide through the menu is really really annoying.  The guide has to explain everything.  And when I say everything, I'm not kidding.  If you're a seasoned gamer, you know what most of the stuff the guide is going to tell you is, yet you still have to sit through it anyway.  The good news is you only have to sit through it once.Previous Pokemon Stadium games also gave you a more RPG like experience.  There was actually more to battling than just the sake of battling.  Here in Battle Revolutions, that's all you're doing.  You're battling just to battle... and you're battling endlessly.  There's no real reason why.  Of course, this isn't a HUGE problem, though, because in the long run battling is quite fun.  I just wish there was some kind of objective here, and some kind of reward to show your achievements to your friends.  Not found here.  Of course, there will be some who really love this.  After all, the point of battle revolutions is to do just that: Battle.Seeing all your favorite Pokemon from Diamond and Pearl is a real treat indeed.  The game has a cartoon like look, but that doesn't mean it isn't impressive.  In truth, it is.  It doesn't take the Wii to its limits, but again, no Pokemon game ever really pushes a system to its limit.  But the game looks good for what is.  Visually the game is great.  It's the other aspects of the graphics that I sometimes find pretty lacking.  It suffers from the same thing Pokemon has suffered from for years.  There's hardly a whole lot of animation going on.  You simply watch your Pokemon step forward and perform the attack, and then you see the other Pokemon take damage.  There's no interaction between the Pokemon.  It's a limitation that doesn't make combat less exciting, but over the past few years you do kind of wish your Pokemon would actually... you know... look like they're battling each other rather than just standing there idly.  Regardless, combat is still pretty solid, and much like the DS games, pretty addictive.As far as DS and Wii connectivity go, this game shows that it can be done.  As you can transfer your Pokemon from your DS to your Wii wirelessly.  However, you get the feeling so much more could've been done with it.  Unless Nintendo plans on making a \"DS Player\" for the Wii, I can't imagine why they wouldn't let you play through your DS games on the big screen.  Again, it's not a big set back, but it is a step back from other Pokemon Stadium installments.  There's also the excitement over using your DS as a controller, but even that feels incomplete sometimes.  Simply because you can't use your DS as a controller in the main game.  You CAN, however, use the DS as a controller when playing against a friend.  It feels limited, though.  Otherwise you can use your Wii-Remote like an NES controller or use the motion sensor controls to point and click.Now there's the online experience.  This is the first real true taste of an Online gaming experience on the Wii.  Unfortunately, like the rest of the game, it feels a bit... incomplete.  The only thing you can do online is battle.  And the battles are all random.  To be honest, if all I wanted to do online was battle... I'd just boot up my DS copy of Diamond or Pearl, and they let you do more online than this game does.  It just feels like the online mode in this game was a test to see if they could actually do it.  The test is a success, but the experience is pretty stale overall.This isn't the kind of game you buy for curiosity's sake.  A lot of it really does feel incomplete.  There's so much potential here, but the overall product feels as though it were rushed.  Previous Pokemon Stadium games had a lot more substance to them.  Pokemon Battle Revolutions is, for the most part, fun.  It just doesn't include a whole lot of content worth getting excited about... because the things that we were getting excited about aren't really all that exciting.  You're pretty much only going to buy this game to battle... but why spend 50 bucks to do so when you could just as easily spend 35 bucks on the DS games?  Besides, without those DS games you can't enjoy the full experience of battling in this game anyway.  It's a good \"test\" to see what the Wii can do, but hopefully the next Pokemon Stadium game will actually push the structure to its limit.\n",
      "Star Fox Adventures frustrated me, and sent me into a love-hate gaming territory I've rarely visited before. Even writing this REVIEW frustrated me.  Because I loved some aspects of Star Fox Adventures, I loathed others with equal passion.On the good side, Star Fox Adventures is beautiful to look at, from the finely rendered fur of the title character, to the supporting characters and several imaginative worlds and environments. It's also occasionally really, really fun to play -- with an enjoyable combination of space battles and creative quests.  In these cases, the game has a very Zelda-like feel, and will be a joy for adventure gamers.I also enjoyed the characters within the game and their development. Some don't enjoy Star Fox's cynicism or world-weary \"I just want to get paid\" attitude, but I liked it. It reminded me of Han Solo in the original Star Wars movies -- of the tough character with the heart of gold.  I'm also in the minority because I frankly loved Fox's sidekick character Tricky -- a cuddly baby dinosaur who's brave, funny, and the closest thing I've seen on Gamecube to a GigaPet. Tricky adds a whole new level to the game because he must be kept fed and happy by feeding him various magical mushrooms at intervals, as well as giving him the occasional chance to play (where, if he's happy enough, he'll change color!). If kept happy, Tricky will not only help Fox in various tasks, but he's also a real help in battling monsters (he can flame them with his breath like a dragon). Tricky has really been brought to life with intelligence and humor -- he's fascinating to watch even when Fox is simply going through his latest fetch quest or series of tasks.  At various times, Tricky may roll in the dirt, take a nap, cackle with glee, or offer consolation or support, nuzzling a scared dinosaur or alerting you to the presence of bad guys.  I was a sucker for this character and really felt affection for him by the end (I know a lot of people found him annoying, though, so maybe I'm just a softie...)But on the down side, most of the puzzles and quests are simply variations on the \"fetch quest\" theme, most involving carrying a barrel of some sort to some other point for access, etc.The most frustrating thing of all, however?  The immense gaps in difficulty between tasks.  One quest you're given might be laughably easy -- while the next task, whether it's a Test of Strength or a speeder chase -- might be so hard as to be unwinnable. The game's Saves are doubly infuriating for this reason, as they're chapter-oriented versus task-oriented. This means you might surpass 3/4 of the tough tasks in one section, quit and save your progress, yet come back later to find you have to replay the entire section again.The Tests of Strength in particular are simply sadistic -- ultimate button-masher challenges which require the repeated pressing of the A button as fast as possible (and I mean FAST).  They're horribly difficult and not much fun, and really hard if your controller doesn't have an autofire capability. I finally only beat these by \"cheating\" after a fashion -- moving a pencil back and forth very quickly across the A button at lightning speed.Even worse (for me at least) were two tasks near the game's end, in Dragon Rock, involving shooting down masses of enemy planes as they pour toward you -- one at a time -- while protecting the slow and hapless dinosaurs you have to ride at the same time.  The first variation of this task (on the back of a slow bronto) I barely got through after two or three days of trying.  The second, in which you have to shoot down four different pillars in turn (at over 15 hits per pillar to bring it down) all while avoiding hordes of enemy ships?  After two solid weeks of trying, I could not do it.  Luckily I have a friend who's a stellar FPS gamer who was able to barely squeak by this point for me (and she took several hours to do it because the odds are so stacked against you).  For younger players or less experienced gamers, this particular task brings the game to a grinding halt.  There is simply no way to get past this impossible (and impassable) task.  Same with some of the speeder races or timed quests -- some of them are babyland-easy, others may take what feels like endless repetition before you are able to progress in the game.These wildly erratic gaps in difficulty mean if you can't get past the latest really really tough task, you're permanently through.  And moments like this just sucked the fun right out of the game for me, despite the fact that I loved other areas (like a spooky moonscape, a seaside town, and the main dinosaur hub city).It's a shame. The game is beautifully rendered and has its good points, but it could have been so much better.\n",

      "This game is boring. You can onlty expoler Hoen and there's not a lot of Pokemon form the other games. You can't connect to the other games and after the elite foure thres nothing for you to do except cath all the pokemon. You can't even travel to fight people in Jhoto and Kanto. Thats why I liked Gold and Sliver but this is stupid. You still have to make due with only Four moves not six or five, but only four moves. and some of the new pokemon is ugly and even some look alike. Also in the Pelterbug forrest cath two Slakouth because you can trade one for a pokemon I can't pronounce in Peltaburg city. In Peltaburg city you have to fight roxanne. She has a Lv. 15 Geodude and LV.14 Nosepass. Nosepass uses a attacked call Rock to mp it reduces your ablie and doese Damage!!! Use berries if you have them. If you have Treecko there is a guy in route 104 that gives a TM called Bullet Seed. teach that TM to Treecko. Bullet Seed is a Grass move that attacks 2 -5 times. It doese crital damage to Rock and fighting pokemon. If you don't have Treccko, another good poke for the gym leader is Dustox. Level up a wrumple to lv.10 and learn confusion. and Gust at lv.13.

      "There are some Nintendo franchises that I wish they'd experiment with a little more.  One of them is Yoshi's Island.  The original Yoshi's Island debuted in 1995, where Yoshi was the main character while Mario took a backseat to all the action (quite literally too).  It was a fun and challenging game.  Nintendo doesn't experiment a lot with the Yoshi's Island series much.  Case in point, the last entry came out in 2006 on the Nintendo DS.  It was a great game too.  Yoshi's New Island, however, feels like it's missing something.  There's some good charm here and good aesthetic quality, but for the most part, Yoshi's New Island is merely just okay.Yoshi's Island, like the many Mario games, has never really been about story.  It's about the gameplay and the journey.  There are six worlds to tackle in Yoshi's New Island.  Each level is your basic 2D side scrolling platformer.  Some levels are very well designed but there's nothing here that's quite as creative as what you saw in the original Yoshi's Island or its DS counterpart.  For the most part many levels are straightforward without really providing the challenge you'd be used to from a Yoshi's Island game.Yoshi controls as he always has.  You can jump on some enemies, but for the most part you'll want to make them into eggs and throw them.  For the most part, the formula hasn't changed.  This can be a good or a bad thing.  Yoshi's Island has a unique means by which you fail.  Instead of there being a certain number of hits that Yoshi takes, what happens when he sustains damage is Baby Mario will float away in a bubble crying, while a timer counts down.  If it reaches zero,Baby Mario is lost to Kamek.  Yoshi's can still perish by falling on spikes or falling down pits, but for the most part as long as Mario stays on Yoshi's back, everything is fine.  You can increase the timer by collecting stars.  There are also still red coins to find among the yellow ones, and five flowers in each level.  For those who must collect everything finding the red coins, five flowers and finishing a level with thirty stars is important.  Every level has a grand total of 100 points.  And you'll only get the full 100 by meeting these conditions.There isn't a whole lot new here.  Yoshi can now turn some enemies into mega eggs which can be used to destroy walls or help him sink in water when he needs to.  It's not something that gets explored a whole lot, however.  Other than that there really isn't that much which separates Yoshi's New Island from the previous two.  It might not be a bad thing, but what makes it stand out so much is that the game's levels just aren't as clever.  Every now and then you find some good memorable levels or a memorable boss fight, but for the most part the level designs aren't as unique as before.  Likewise, they are also not as challenging.  One of the best aspects about the Yoshi's Island games was that they were not especially easy games.  In fact, they could be maddeningly hard at times to the point of frustration.  Yoshi's Island DS in particular is still a fairly challenging game.  Yoshi's New Island is a little too easy by comparison.  There are some surprises but the game isn't going to test you very much.The ease of the game is compounded by the fact that Nintendo still seems to have this idea that if you ARE failing too much you need a crutch to help you succeed.  Fail too much in Yoshi's New Island and you'll get wings that allow you to pretty much fly all you want.  If you STILL continue to die too much you'll then get a gold wing that'll let you fly around AND avoid taking damage.  Yoshi's New Island is hardly challenging to need such a handholding device.  More than that, as with so many of Nintendo's platformers... extra lives are plentiful.  Even if you manage to fail a thousand times you'll probably never see a game over screen.  It's easy to rack up far too many lives.  In comparison to the two games before it, this one borders on coddling the player.  If the levels weren't so simple and there was a greater challenge the need to provide several lives or a crutch to players might be somewhat justified.  As it stands, however, Yoshi's New Island isn't quite like that.But really the other truth is that after a while the game simply becomes more boring than previous games in the series.  The levels have some creative spark to them but some of the best moments are few and far between.  The new aspects introduced here aren't really expanded on, and at times they aren't even that necessary.  We're introduced to them but the game eventually carries on without them.  After such a long wait it's a shame, really, that there isn't much more given to us.  Nintendo isn't beyond banking on our nostalgia, but usually there's something added to the experience to make sure you know it's about more than just childhood memories.  The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between didn't just bet on your memories of A Link to the Past, it went out of it's way to introduce aspects that played a key role within the game.  It becomes more than just a nostalgia trip.  There's nothing new here, and you won't be too compelled to go after all the points in a stage.  There's a lot of nostalgia and some clever level design in some spots, but for the most part the game as a whole feels a lot more bland.  The vehicle segments in particular, aren't very fun because they incorporate the 3DS gyro controls and they don't always handle so well.  It feels less like a clever ploy and more like a tacked on gimmick.The graphical presentation is charming.  A lot of it looks much more like an oil painting this time around.  In some regards this is fine, but the crayon style of the Super Nintendo game was most certainly more appealing.  It only goes to show that aesthetics matter quite a bit.  That's not to say Yoshi's Island looks bad.  It most certainly doesn't.  The look is charming and detailed.  Although nothing here looks like it's too out of the ordinary.  There are a lot of familiar enemies and objects here.  It's a shame, actually, that Yoshi's New Island doesn't have a great deal of new enemies or even a lot of new design choices.  There's a lot of stuff you'll see here that looks as though it were pulled form the original Super Nintendo game and simply given a polish.  Other times the oil painting can make some of the game look muddied, even in spots where you don't want it to.Let's be clear, Yoshi's New Island isn't a bad game.  In fact it's actually quite good.  It's just that you expect Nintendo to reach a little higher with their platformers.  Especially when handling a property as important as Yoshi.  When Donkey Kong Country returned there was certainly nostalgia, but there were also elements that helped make you realize it wasn't just another Donkey Kong Country game.  It had elements that made it stand out in creative level design, great new mechanics and a challenge that reminded us why we loved old platformers in the first place.  Yoshi's New Island doesn't quite reach that high.  Given how long it's been since a new Yoshi game, it's a little disheartening that Yoshi's New Island only manages to feel like a nostalgia trip.  It's a short game as well, though this was to be expected.  It'll take you perhaps five or six hours to get through it.  And this is where the real issue comes in.  It is not that the game can be beaten in five or six hours that is the issue.  The issue is that Yoshi's New Island doesn't compel you to play it again, nor will you find much incentive to try and score 100 points on every level.  If there were a great deal of replay value here the five or six hours wouldn't be an issue at all.If you've never played a Yoshi game before this certainly serves as a good introduction.  If you have, however, you'll find everything you remember is here, but you'll also find that Nintendo certainly didn't take as much care and devotion with bringing Yoshi back as they could have.\n",
      "I can still remember playing Super Mario Bros 2 for the first time. It was a huge change in gameplay from the first game, where you collected coins, jumped on Goombas and Koopas, went down pipes, and took out Bowser at the end of each castle level. Instead of doing any of that, you now defeated enemies by picking them up and throwing them at each other, or by throwing vegetables or bombs at them. There weren't any pipes to go down, but now there were odd vases that had treasures in them, but didn't take you to a later part in the level. Bowser and the Koopas were replaced with little masked enemies, snakes and egg-spitting monsters. And rather than being stuck with Mario or Luigi, you could also play as Toad and Princess Toadstool. Yep, it sure didn't feel like a Mario game (that's because it really wasn't) but man did people love this one back in the day. I loved the game both on the NES and SNES where it was a part of the Super Mario All-Stars collection. Now that my daughter's gotten into gaming big time, we played through the game on the Mario All-Stars collection for the Wii, but I got her the GBA version too so she could play it on the go. I'd missed out on this version when the GBA first came out over 10 years ago, and as soon as I started the first level, I couldn't figure out what they were thinking when they made this port.Gameplay remains the same more or less, and I talked a little bit about it above. The game's still a platformer at heart, and there are 3 levels in each world (though the final world just has 2) to go through. Most of the worlds are either grasslands or desert, but there's also an ice world and one in the clouds. You run through the stage, taking out any enemies in your way, or avoiding them almost entirely. You can even roam through most of the levels in their entirety at your own leisure- there's no time limit, and the game lets you go back to the beginning as long as you have a way of getting there. In every level you'll see little bits of red grass swaying in the wind. These can be picked up with the B button, and will usually be a vegetable to throw at your enemies. Sometimes you'll get a bomb, turtle shell or 1-Up mushroom, and sometimes you'll get a magical red potion. When you throw this, it creates a door that, when opened, leads you to Sub-Space where the red grass creates coins when you pull it up, and giant mushrooms can be found that add one heart to your health. It all depends on where you throw these to get the health mushroom, and it's best to throw these in areas with lots of red grass, so you can get lots of coins, which are used in a slot machine mini-game when you clear each stage, and is a way to get extra lives. But the Sub-Space can also lead to a warp zone in certain areas, letting you travel to later worlds.Then there's the whole character selection part, which was really cool when the game first came out. You had Mario, who was the all-around average guy, with a good running speed, jumping height, and strength for pulling up vegetables at a fast pace. Luigi wasn't as strong as Mario, or fast, but has the highest jump of anyone. Princess Toadstool was the slowest, weakest and had a fairly average jump, but her main skill was that she could float around in the air for a few seconds before falling, as long as you held the A button. Toad seemed like the worst character, but when you figured out that there were differences in the strengths and speeds of the characters, and not just the jumps, he tended to be a favorite. He had has the lowest jump...but is the fastest and strongest. What's the point in having a lot of strength for picking up the vegetables? Well, when you go into a Sub-Space area with lots of coins that need to be pulled up, Toad is going to be cleaning house, and there's a great chance that you can get 9 or more coins in one go. On top of all of this, there's also a super jump ability where if you hold down on the d-pad for a few seconds, your character will glow, and they can jump much higher than they normally can. This is only really used in a few situations, but still fun to do every now and then.So if it's a fun game, with running around throwing veggies at the bad guys, what's with the 3 star rating? This GBA version has so many things added to it that it feels like they made it for people who've never played a game before. Before, if you lost a heart, you'd have to defeat a few enemies to make a little heart icon show up, then you'd have to chase after it and nab it in order to get your health back. Here, hearts are so common that you'd think they're going out of style. You get hearts from defeating two enemies or more in the same throw, can pull them up from the ground, and sometimes they're just sitting there in the stage, waiting for you to get them. It's hard to NOT die in this game. What's weird is they seemed to try and add a tiny bit of challenge by starting you out with two hearts, but one of them empty (as opposed to two full hearts in the original), but with it being so easy to get the second heart full, what's the point? There are also giant versions of some of the enemies and vegetables, making it even easier to take out big groups. I get the novelty of this, and it -is- cool to see Luigi pull up a massive turnip at first, but the game was just fine the way it was before. And guess what- the red coins that they seemingly crowbar into every other Mario game since Mario 64 are here too. They also included a point system, and a score is displayed at the top of the screen, to make it more Mario-ish I guess. But the icing on the cake for horrible things is that the characters talk. And it's not just a little bit either, no. They say something every single time you pick up and throw an item. With how often you're plucking vegetables and coins, this gets old VERY fast, to the point where I turned the volume down all the way after the first stage. The changes I do like include a new robot boss and certain revisions to levels, though there are very few of these. And as usual for the Mario Advance games, the original Mario Bros. arcade game is here to play.If you have the option to play Super Mario All-Stars on your Wii or SNES still, I recommend sticking with those and ignoring this version. A lot of the challenge is gone, and those voices are so grating that it makes you wonder why they were put in. I hate to sound like one of those old darshes that go on and on about how 'the original was better' or seems like they hate new takes on old things, but man do I not care for this game. Even if you can't get All-Stars, but have a Wii, you can get the original NES game on the Virtual Console for a very low price. Give it a go. The only difference between that and the SNES/Wii versions is the visuals and audio. It's still fun and very playable.\n",
      "I can still remember playing Super Mario Bros 2 for the first time. It was a huge change in gameplay from the first game, where you collected coins, jumped on Goombas and Koopas, went down pipes, and took out Bowser at the end of each castle level. Instead of doing any of that, you now defeated enemies by picking them up and throwing them at each other, or by throwing vegetables or bombs at them. There weren't any pipes to go down, but now there were odd vases that had treasures in them, but didn't take you to a later part in the level. Bowser and the Koopas were replaced with little masked enemies, snakes and egg-spitting monsters. And rather than being stuck with Mario or Luigi, you could also play as Toad and Princess Toadstool. Yep, it sure didn't feel like a Mario game (that's because it really wasn't) but man did people love this one back in the day. I loved the game both on the NES and SNES where it was a part of the Super Mario All-Stars collection. Now that my daughter's gotten into gaming big time, we played through the game on the Mario All-Stars collection for the Wii, but I got her the GBA version too so she could play it on the go. I'd missed out on this version when the GBA first came out over 10 years ago, and as soon as I started the first level, I couldn't figure out what they were thinking when they made this port.Gameplay remains the same more or less, and I talked a little bit about it above. The game's still a platformer at heart, and there are 3 levels in each world (though the final world just has 2) to go through. Most of the worlds are either grasslands or desert, but there's also an ice world and one in the clouds. You run through the stage, taking out any enemies in your way, or avoiding them almost entirely. You can even roam through most of the levels in their entirety at your own leisure- there's no time limit, and the game lets you go back to the beginning as long as you have a way of getting there. In every level you'll see little bits of red grass swaying in the wind. These can be picked up with the B button, and will usually be a vegetable to throw at your enemies. Sometimes you'll get a bomb, turtle shell or 1-Up mushroom, and sometimes you'll get a magical red potion. When you throw this, it creates a door that, when opened, leads you to Sub-Space where the red grass creates coins when you pull it up, and giant mushrooms can be found that add one heart to your health. It all depends on where you throw these to get the health mushroom, and it's best to throw these in areas with lots of red grass, so you can get lots of coins, which are used in a slot machine mini-game when you clear each stage, and is a way to get extra lives. But the Sub-Space can also lead to a warp zone in certain areas, letting you travel to later worlds.Then there's the whole character selection part, which was really cool when the game first came out. You had Mario, who was the all-around average guy, with a good running speed, jumping height, and strength for pulling up vegetables at a fast pace. Luigi wasn't as strong as Mario, or fast, but has the highest jump of anyone. Princess Toadstool was the slowest, weakest and had a fairly average jump, but her main skill was that she could float around in the air for a few seconds before falling, as long as you held the A button. Toad seemed like the worst character, but when you figured out that there were differences in the strengths and speeds of the characters, and not just the jumps, he tended to be a favorite. He had has the lowest jump...but is the fastest and strongest. What's the point in having a lot of strength for picking up the vegetables? Well, when you go into a Sub-Space area with lots of coins that need to be pulled up, Toad is going to be cleaning house, and there's a great chance that you can get 9 or more coins in one go. On top of all of this, there's also a super jump ability where if you hold down on the d-pad for a few seconds, your character will glow, and they can jump much higher than they normally can.

      "I honestly don't believe New Super Mario Bros. for the Wii is a bad game by ANY means.  However it basically does nothing that the original SMB NES series hasn't already done and perfected, not to mention uses several of the Super Mario World concepts as well.  This game is basically just a graphically enhanced version of the classic Super Mario Bros. series and copies what's already been done and the only real addition are two new power suits- the overrated penguin suit that gives Mario the ability to slide around, and the admittedly pretty awesome propeller suit- a VERY convenient and popular item that lets Mario reach the star coins in tricky locations (more on that below).Look at the backgrounds in the first few stages and worlds.  The grasslands is basically nothing new- the first Super Mario Bros. and SMB3 games already perfected these similar backgrounds many years ago.  The concept of collecting coins, stomping on goombas, avoiding koopas, etc, has all remained *exactly* the same, so this definitely means Nintendo is cashing in on the improved technology of the Wii to bring back an old platform favorite of millions.  And you know, I actually don't mind the decision to bring it back *that* much (hence the 3-star rating).  I just wish the game wasn't so identical to the classic Mario Bros. games in so many crucial areas.  Gameplay, level design, and backgrounds all resemble the original SMB games.  This makes New Super Mario Bros. Wii nothing particularly noteworthy or original- just something intended for newbies of the 2D sidescroller series and hardly providing anything original for any of the older Mario Bros. fans.The similarities are obvious, everywhere.  The ghost houses, moving platforms and lava stages shamelessly copy what's already been done in Super Mario World *especially* in the case of the ghost houses.  They are boring in this game.  The desert world looks a lot like the one from Super Mario Bros. 3 on the All-Stars edition.  The same similarities present themselves in the ice and water worlds.  After a while you totally forget about the graphics being Nintendo's selling point here since you're so caught up in the cliched gameplay (which admittedly is *fun* gameplay, but nothing original).  I expected Nintendo would make the overall experience more impactful by taking advantage of the Wii's technology.  The platform jumps themselves are really bland in the first few worlds since the stages themselves aren't very memorable.  The one with icicles falling down and creating platforms to progress forward is too bland for words.  This stuff wasn't boring back in the 80's and early 90's, but bringing back the same concept in today's world doesn't really work in my opinion.  New Super Mario Bros. Wii just falls short of greatness.Some of the things I love- the challenge of the special world (World 9).  It's a VERY challenging world to acquire all the star coins.  Collecting 3 star coins per stage throughout the first 8 worlds is important since they enable World 9 to open.  World 8's very first level is *incredible*.  A fast paced run to the finish with cool music in the background with a rockin' rhythm.  That's clearly the best music in the game.  The challenge is actually pretty high starting around World 7, but World 9 takes the cake in that regard.  World 9 is almost unbearably difficult at times (at least, if your intention is to collect the 3 star coins and this *should* be your intention otherwise you'd be missing out on the bonus world).  The Bowser fight is amazing too- much better than any of the fights in the classic Mario series.  Now you have to outrun his wall-destroying fireballs to reach safety!  Really exciting race to the finish.  Unfortunately the same cannot be said for his Koopa kids- those fights are basically not much different than the ones in SMB3.  They're actually easier and most of them are lame.  One Koopa kid fight has platforms moving up and down while you try and land on his head 3 times.  It's really easy believe me.  They dumbed down Wendy too- her rings are easy to avoid now.  Boo!  Mini Bowser, or Bowser Jr., presents a few interesting fights along the way however.  The battle where you have to ram his spaceship into an electric wall is REALLY fun.  The airship-type levels aren't nearly as memorable as the SMB3 ones I'm afraid.  They aren't lengthy or bomb-explosive enough.Still, despite the first half of the game being derivative and bland, the second half of the game is actually a pretty big improvement (though inconsistent at times, but I'm in a generous and forgiving mood).  I wish the game wasn't so generous with 1-ups though.  You can easily max out at 99 by World 8.  This is a result of the game just being too darn easy.  It's okay to lose lives once in a while, something many new gamers don't believe in.  You had to grow up in the NES days to understand that it's okay to die when encountering an overwhelming challenge.  In fact you're *supposed* to die until you find a way to complete it.  I recommend skipping over this game and picking up New Super Mario Bros. U instead- despite being another copycat of the classic SMB series of yesteryears, THAT game is incredibly fun and harder overall with more exciting platform jumps and item collecting along the way.  SMBU fills in all the tiny details that effectively makes the levels more exciting and creative compared to this average Wii New Super Mario Bros. game.  Lay down the extra bucks for a Wii U and go with New Super Mario Bros. U instead if you're in such desperate need of a new 2D Mario game.\n",
      "By the time Capcom released MEGA MAN VI on the NES, it was obvious to all in the industry that Nintendo's 8-Bit console, the machine that resurrected the video game market in the mid 1980s to the multibillion dollar industry that it is now, was on its last legs.  Capcom wanted to move Mega Man to the SNES, but before doing so, they made a final chapter for everyone's favorite blue bomber.Ironically enough, Capcom chose not to release MEGA MAN VI in the United States, publishing the game only in Japan, due to their decision to put their efforts behind the new MEGA MAN X series.  When Capcom informed Nintendo of this decision, Nintendo took it upon themselves to publish the game in America, which is why the game was never released in Europe.How does it stand up to the other five games?  Actually, not that bad.  It's obvious Capcom is running out of ideas.  The basic story is that a mysterious Mr. X (gee, I wonder who that could be) has been setting up a robot tournament, and when Mega Man shows up, all the robots turn against Mega Man and Mr X tries to take over the world.  Naturally, when you defeat Mr X, turns out it is Dr. Wiley and you have to go into a second castle.  While Mega Man IV and V at least at an element of surprise in their \"twist\" ending, by VI you can tell it's Wiley from the beginning, even kinda looks like him.First off, the graphics are top notch, and so is the sound.  But that is little surprise as Mega Man always had great graphics for the NES.Capcom was so bereft of ideas They even had contestant winners in Nintendo Power design two of the robot bosses (Wind Man, designed by Michael Leader of the US, and Knight Man, designed by Daniel Vallie of Canada).The other six bosses are largely retreads of previous robot masters or just plain ridiculous.We have Plant Man (who, might I add, is the single worst boss in not only Mega Man, but in all of video games - he's just gay).  His (lame) weapon is a flower shield, and basically he's a poor boy version of the superior Leaf Man from MEGA MAN II.  We have Blizzard Man, who for whatever reason is on skis.  Ripoff of Air Man from II and Ice Man from the first game.  Flame Man is yet another heat-based robot master (we've already had Fire Man from I, Heat Man from II, and Napalm Man from V).  We have Tomahawk Man, who is very formidable, but still feels out of place and like Capcom was really stretching for ideas.  Centaur Man is at least somewhat imaginative. The worst, though, is Yamato Man.  Apparently Yamato is a geographical term in Japan.  It'd be like Oxford Man or Birmingshire Man or Las Vegas Man.  Incomprehensible.  Stupid.  Even Wind Man, who was designed by one of the contestant winners, is little more than another version of Air Man.The levels themselves, while compentant, are hardly what you call inspired.  A lot of them you have seen before in previous incarnations, especially Flame Man's level (come on, we've had fire-themed levels before).A bad part of the levels is that four of them have false endings, I guess in attempts from Capcom to give the game more replayability. In each of the levels for Tomahawk Man, Yamato Man, Knight Man, and Centaur Man, two separate boss chambers appear, one more difficult to reach than the other.  By accessing the more difficult of the two you get one of four letters (B, E, A, T), and when you get all four you can now use Beat, the robotic bird from Mega Man V.  Quite frankly, the fake endings are rather dumb.The last levels have some engaging moments, even though one of the castle bosses (a big dragon) is a little too similar too the boss dragon of Mega Man II for my comfort.  There's another stage in the Wiley's castle which is primarily dirty water and those spiked orbs, which is again a throw back to Mega Man II.The end features Dr Wiley being thrown in jail, with the last words and a newspaper picture printed.  The ending provides good closure for the series, but then Capcom spoils that by saying \"To be continued\".  Still a good way to close the NES leg of Mega Man's journey as far as story-wise goes.Mega Man also has some new features.  Taking a page from Mario, he has a rush adapter that allows him to fly (albeit, pretty briefly).  This is featured prominently on the game art.  Beat returns.  I would like to have flown longer, given how much this was hyped.Is MEGA MAN VI a good game? Yes.  Without a doubt.  It would be an even better game its five predecessors did not exist.  Because ultimately, even though they tried adding some new things to the Mega Man formula, at the end of the day, Capcom with this title feels tired and uninspired, like they trying to squeeze one more dollar out of the Mega Man franchise.  But that's largely because MEGA MAN VI is just more of the same.  If you like the formula you'll love this title.  But it is still very formulaic.All the NES Mega Man games are good, but they're largely the same.  I'd go with II or III first, but if you haven't played any Mega Man games VI is a good place to start.  But II and III should be your first choice.\n",

      "Donkey Kong Country was a big deal when it came out in late 1994. It was -the- game to get, and sold out everywhere in no time. I remember reading game magazines that had screen shots, and I couldn't believe what I was seeing. This was a GAME?? It looked like a movie or something! They say graphics don't make a game, but they sure as heck didn't hurt DKC. The game was, and still is beautiful to look at. Essentially, DKC is a Super Mario World clone, but with so much more style. You could have two players play co-operatively, or competitively. There were 101 hidden areas, many of which required you to drop off of platforms to find them or go behind the beginning of a level- something not many people figured out for a while. It also has what I consider the greatest soundtrack of any game. Yeah, I played this for hours and hours, and was excited to get the GBA version for my daughter since she's pretty big on the main Nintendo guys now too. While she likes playing it, as a veteran of the original, I find this \"enhanced port\" very disappointing. If you still have your SNES, track down the cart. If you have a Wii, I'm pretty sure you can get the DKC games on the Virtual Console.Playing the game is simple- you play as Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong, as they go after the Kremlings (big nasty reptile dudes) and other henchmen of King K. Rool. Kong's bananas were stolen by them, and he wants 'em back. You run, jump, slam, roll, cartwheel, and barrel your way through level after level, finding hidden areas as you progress. If you've played a Mario game, or even an older Sonic one, that's what DKC plays like, and it's great fun. Just like the old Donkey Kong- DK throws barrels at enemies. Some are regular barrels that keep rolling until they fall off a ledge, some break upon impact, and some are TNT barrels that can blow up walls and multiple enemies. There are also a couple of friends to help the Kongs, like Rambi the rhino who hauls ass and rams through anything in his path. Winky, the frog who can jump high and even take out the spiked Zinger enemies. Expresso the ostrich floats gently after jumping, and can run pretty fast too. And Enguarde, a swordfish for the water levels, that lunges at any baddies who come your way.So if the game's so much fun, what happened when it was ported to the GBA? While most people complain about the graphics and music getting toned down ('kinda expected considering just how much this game pushed the SNES when it came out compared to Super Mario World and others), that's not my problem...though it does suck that the perfect soundtrack is missing a lot of the magic it originally had. No, my problem is a bunch of little things. Donkey Kong can now either jump higher, or a lot of the levels were shortened. This is apparent right off the bat in the first level, where you can go back into the tree house to get a 1-up balloon. Originally, you had to bounce on the tire in there to get it, but now, DK can just jump up on his own and nab it. This hurts him more than it helps in some levels, since there are enemies on platforms above here and there, and you can now easily jump into them, losing DK. Hit detection is also very weird. There'd be times where I swore I jumped on an enemy, only to have Diddy Kong take the hit and run away. Hey, if I jump on a Kremling's head, I expect him to be taken out, not have Diddy somehow fall through it, then get hit by him. They also added a couple of very, very stupid mini-games, a fishing one and a dancing one which I'm sure you'll play for all of 2 minutes, then never touch again. There are also pictures/cameras to collect, but I found it to be more tacked on than a cool extra feature. This port just screams lazy, and by taking time to add extra things that are dumb and pointless, I don't get why they could've just given us a straight port and save some hassle.The one pro though? Boss fights are much harder, and I loved this. It was a big surprise when I fought the Zinger boss, and had to throw barrels at smaller Zingers that surrounded it after each hit. The Master Necky Sr. fight is good too, since you now have to fight the original Necky at the same time, having two bosses at once. 'added some good extra challenge.I know it might seem nitpicky to dock stars because of what might be harmless additions, but the hit detection ruined a lot of the fun for me. I swear, there was one level that I never had trouble with on the SNES, yet died 32 times on in this version. Also, when you're riding an animal with both Kongs, instead of having the other Kong trail behind, both ride the animal, and when you attack, it looks like your partner is...well, a partner in more ways than one. 'could've done without that too, though it never fails to make me laugh. Still, if you've never played DKC and a GBA or DS is your only system, you should pick it up. Just know that the game is much better in regular form.\n",

While most people complain about the graphics and music getting toned down ('kinda expected considering just how much this game pushed the SNES when it came out compared to Super Mario World and others), that's not my problem...though it does suck that the perfect soundtrack is missing a lot of the magic it originally had. No, my problem is a bunch of little things. Donkey Kong can now either jump higher, or a lot of the levels were shortened. This is apparent right off the bat in the first level, where you can go back into the tree house to get a 1-up balloon. Originally, you had to bounce on the tire in there to get it, but now, DK can just jump up on his own and nab it. This hurts him more than it helps in some levels, since there are enemies on platforms above here and there, and you can now easily jump into them, losing DK. Hit detection is also very weird. There'd be times where I swore I jumped on an enemy, only to have Diddy Kong take the hit and run away. Hey, if I jump on a Kremling's head, I expect him to be taken out, not have Diddy somehow fall through it, then get hit by him. They also added a couple of very, very stupid mini-games, a fishing one and a dancing one which I'm sure you'll play for all of 2 minutes, then never touch again. There are also pictures/cameras to collect, but I found it to be more tacked on than a cool extra feature. This port just screams lazy, and by taking time to add extra things that are dumb and pointless, I don't get why they could've just given us a straight port and save some hassle.The one pro though? Boss fights are much harder, and I loved this. It was a big surprise when I fought the Zinger boss, and had to throw barrels at smaller Zingers that surrounded it after each hit. The Master Necky Sr. fight is good too, since you now have to fight the original Necky at the same time, having two bosses at once. 'added some good extra challenge.I know it might seem nitpicky to dock stars because of what might be harmless additions, but the hit detection ruined a lot of the fun for me. I swear, there was one level that I never had trouble with on the SNES, yet died 32 times on in this version. Also, when you're riding an animal with both Kongs, instead of having the other Kong trail behind, both ride the animal, and when you attack, it looks like your partner is...well, a partner in more ways than one. 'could've done without that too, though it never fails to make me laugh. Still, if you've never played DKC and a GBA or DS is your only system, you should pick it up. Just know that the game is much better in regular form.\n",
      "\"Dear God, please let this horrible game be a figment of my imagination\"Nope, it's real.  What an unbelievable piece of overrated garbage Super Mario Bros. 3 is.  For the life of me I don't get the appeal of this game.  Through each of the eight boring worlds it's just the same thing every time: run to the end of each and every extremely short, uncreative level collecting worthless crap so you can move on to the next short, uncreative level.  Super Mario Bros. 3 is complete baboon poop.  It really is.  Nothing good about this game at all.  No reason for Mario or video game fans to remember this crappy adventure.  No reason for this game to exist.  Thank God there are sensible people out there such as myself to give you the honest truth.Let's get right to the point and talk about all the stinky things:One, and this is the biggest reason Super Mario Bros. 3 isn't any good.  You can only play as Mario and Luigi.  In Super Mario Bros. 2 you can play as the Princess and Toad in addition to Mario and Luigi.  Not so here.  In this game, Mario and Luigi don't even have anything unique to separate the two, so they are basically the same exact person (except Mario is red and Luigi is green).  Remember how high Luigi can jump in Super Mario Bros. 2?  Well now he jumps just like Mario.  Absolutely no reason for this.  If anything, Luigi should have MANY more interesting things about him this time around since, after all, Super Mario Bros. 3 comes AFTER Super Mario Bros. 2 and you'd think the most logical thing would be to continue adding MORE things with each new series.  But in this case, you get less.  I guess Nintendo FORGOT to make Luigi stand apart from Mario.Another problem: this game is so freakin' predictable.  Gee, after the desert world I go to... a water world?  You don't say!  What?  There's an ICE world and a plant world coming up?  No way!  And what's THIS I see?  The final world will be BIG DARK EVIL FIRE WORLD?  I didn't see THAT coming.  Thanks Nintendo, for making Mario fans look like complete idiots.  Way to go.Other serious problems become noticeable after a couple hours of playtime such as the fact that you have to do so much boring jumping in this game.  You have to jump on top of (or over) SO many things that it becomes an absolute chore after world 3 (if you even MAKE it that far without shutting off the game, that is).  If you find anything exciting about jumping over pipes or jumping on top of goombas or picking up and kicking buzzy beetles, then I recommend seeking professional help.Ok, what else makes Super Mario Bros. 3 suck so much?  It can't get any worse, right?  Yes it can.  After you beat the game a message comes up on the screen that says \"Thank you, but our princess is in another castle.  Just kidding, hahaha\".  You mean to tell me, after all that long, hard and tedious work making it to the very end, Nintendo is going to joke around and make like the adventure isn't over yet?  Before the \"just kidding\" part, you might very well rip apart your controller or punch a hole in your TV screen all because Nintendo wants to play around and pretend there's still more to the adventure.  I can't even think of appropriate words to describe how angry this makes me.  Tears of anger are almost dripping down my face.  Nintendo NEVER should have done that.  I bet that most people who first seen that message really thought the princess was in another castle and came THIS close to killing the nearest living thing next to them.  Bad Nintendo.And guess what?  You have to face one of Bowser's kids at the end of every world.  I'm not kidding.  I was honestly expecting to fight Bowser's WIFE before fighting him, but it never happened.  That's probably for the better.  Who knows how horrific she looks.I'm still trying to figure out what everyone sees in this game.  It's old and forgettable.  Honestly, I think nowadays the only people who enjoy Super Mario Bros. 3 are older folks whose children have moved away to college or to start a family, and they left behind their NES and Super Mario Bros. 3 cartridge so their parents had something to do.  All these older folks miraculously happen to enjoy the game so now EVERYONE acts like it's the best game of all-time.  Well it's not. the graphics suck, boring game\n",

       "[\"I used to love this game; but now it's dated and now that I look back on it, it's not as fun now, either way, here's my review.Graphics: 8.5/10. This is a more realistic snowboarding game, so there are very realistic colors; unlike snowboarding kids or anything with very bright colors. 1080 features very realistic physics and is very sophisticated. Anyways, the graphics I remember loving mainly because of the powdery snow. I liked to edge in deep snow just because it was it was so fluffy. For that, this game got what it got in this category.Sound: 9/10. Whether you go through a foot of snow or right accross jagged ice, there's a different noise. There is a different sound for everything, which is strange because really for the most part in many games on the N64 there is the same or a very similar song for everything in the game.Control: 8/10. Very, very realistic and solid, but It's frustrating for that reason. it is really realistic so you really have to land FLAT to get land, which can be frustrating for little kids. There is also damage; so if you get beat up a lot you will not win the race.Fun: 8.5/10. Nice and realistic, great events, and different difficulties for every age and cool characters make this a must play for any  owner of an N64.9/10\",\n",
       " \"This game definitly fits the thought I had of a snowboarding game when I set out to buy one. The graphics are moderately realstic, the control is ok, and the sound is mediocre. I think they could of done a lot better job designing a game like this, but this edition suffices.It is one of the only snowboarding games on the N64, which was one of the reasons i bought it. Another reason is the outstanding multiplayer coordination. I bought this as soon as I played it at a friend's house. You unfortunatley play with only 2 players at a time, but it is still fun to play your friend head to head.  There are 6 courses, and under single player you can also do half pipe and air make. There are 5 characters that you can use to race, and more of which you can unlock. since there are only 60 head to head course combinations, there are other things you can do, like trick or time attacks.This can take a bit to get used to, as it can be boring for the single player. If you have a will and a friend however, this game will surely be worth it.\",\n",
       " \"In comparison to other N64 games, this piece is a worthwhile buy.  The single player mode is challenging enough to warrant playing for a while to unlock the secret characters.  Two player mode gets pretty boring, pretty quickly because there are only 6 tracks to race on so there's not much variety.  The stunt mode is the main appeal of the game and could easily occupy you for hours.  However, it soon just becomes a thumb spinning frenzy for points.  Given this is fun for a while but it gets all that white junk inside the control stick holder, and ruins thumb coordination for the rest of the day.  So buy this game and spin in circles to your heart's content.\",\n",
       " 'The game in many ways is like tony hawk.  In fact, the only differnt thing this snowboarding.  The graphic and gameplay are good.  With 5 differnt boarders to use and alot of tracks, the game is worth the money.',\n",
       " \"I'm 23 now, got the game when it first came out when I was around 12. Still the bet snowboarding game of all time. So much fun that I still get the n64 out here and there simply to play this game. Has a time attack mode, trick mode, racing series, and a mixture of them all. Just a great classic that rates up their with 007 Goldeneye for classic N64 games that could last forever for those every now and then gamers like myself. Great game...that's highly reccomended.\",\n",
       " \"When my cousin first got this on his birthday, I was thinking &quot; this is just gonna be like all the other snowboarding games I've played&quot;.  Man was I wrong!  With 8 levels of exciting, heart stopping jump, twists and turns, this is one game you don't wanna miss.  It has all the best modes, Match Race&lt;this is where you earn hidden levels against the computer&gt;, 2 Player, Trick Attack, Time Attack,and Contest, this is one game that won't get tiring fast.  Heed this warning:if you buy this game, don't go after the 1080 just yet, it's hard to master.  What more do I have to say?  Buy this game!\",\n",
       " \"Once you get the hang of the controls, this game is awesome... it's challenging and entertaining, and everyone should have one.This game has amazing graphics-- you can even see the snow spray off the board when you make the slightest turn. Plus, the camera controls are flawless. The sound track is pretty good, too- you can hear the snowboard scraping and the snowboarders sometimes talk, and the techo tracks that accompany the races are pretty cool too.My only complaint is that there aren't enough courses. After I unlocked the 6 courses and beat the &quot;Black Diamond&quot; level, there wasn't much else to do. But even after you've unlocked all the courses, it's still fun to play against your friends in the 2 Person VS mode, or doing tricks in the half pipe.I think that anyone who has a N64 should add this game to their collection, without a doubt... it's a solid game, and you won't regret it.\",\n",
       " \"Without any doubt, 1080 Snowboarding is probably the best snowboarding game available.The difficulty of the controls are a little more difficult than other snowboarding games and may take a little bit more time to master, but it's well worth it. Landing correctly is also a little harder to do than normal.The mode and track selection is very nice, offering a nice variety of tracks and available modes. The tracks offer beautiful scenery, sometimes very big jumps, jumping over cars, and a lot more.The tricks and the stunts selection that you can perform is very reasonable. Although you can't go beyond 1080 degree turns, there are other tricks that you might not find in any other snowboarding game.1080 also includes a Training mode, which includes two different sections, the halfpipe and a straight run with moguls. When you begin, you can turn into the left gate for the halfpipe to practice your tricks, or you can head into the right gate for a straight downhill run with moguls scattered all over. When you finish, you start back up at the main gate and you keep going until you decide to quit.1080 also has a few secret riders and boards within the game.Overall, 1080 is probably the best snowboarding game around, without any doubt. Would be definitely worth buying.\",\n",

I love the tracks, the weapons, the characters(Yoshi's my favorite), and simplely how much fun this game still delivers to this very day. The replay value is endless, and multiplayer is still very engaging(It's always fun to humiliate your friends at this game).

It\\'s filled with ice and is just fun to cruise through! And the penguins that you can run into are so cute!The playable characters are your basic eight: Mario (balance), Luigi (balanced), Princess Peach (lightweight), Toad (lightweight), Yoshi (advanced), Donkey Kong (heavyweight), Wario (heavyweight) and Bowser (the heavi\"est\"weight).This game is very, VERY easy to just pick up and play with friends. The controls are simple as all get out and the characters look pretty cool, for a N64 game.

First of all, it has a lower polygon count and the characters look much better. The gameplay is simple, but that only means it's easier to learn. The card that comes with the game tells you everything you need to know so all you have to do is plop the game inside the console and start playing.So the characters don't say much. It's mainly just a simple &quot;Yippee!&quot; or &quot;I'm-a Wario and I'm-a gonna win!,&quot; but there's much more in-game speech than GoldenEye. Sound effects are fine too. The soundtrack is excellent. It ranges from coutry to smooth jazz. Even some major critics of video game music I know have said that the music here is great. You know Koji Kondo's doing something right hearing that.Mario Kart 64 is addicting with four players, and it can be addicting with one player too. The Time Trials may be a little disappointing, but the Mario GP had me coming back for more.The game is one of the best racing games on the N64. It's better than WaveRace, Diddy Kong Racing, F-Zero X, and even Excitebike 64. Heck it's one of the best games on the N64!

From DK to Bowser, Peach to Toad, this game has most of the characters that have been involved with Mario in some way. The graphics are great for its time, the sound is fun, the worlds are colorful, the idea is great. Who wouldn't like this game- at ANY age?

       " \"Truly a classic. This game was one of the first I got for the N64, and it is one of my favorites today. As it gives graphics that were hardly ever seen in the early N64 days, it also has gameplay almost unmatched by the games of it's era. The sound is moderate, but sound isnt a very big facter in deciding the rating of the game.A followup on the early SNES version that was also a hit, this game was certainly watched before it's release date, as it stormed into the N64 world and took many fans (as you can see from it's very high review in many chances) right away. It was considered as a very high class game then, and now too. Many of the N64 owners today have one in their hands, and many of those have played the game for over 24 hrs.This game has wonderful graphics and sound for the era that it was made in. The size of a typical game back then, but with the technical advancements of some of the games today. The graphics are very good, as you can distinguish all characters and objects faster than immediatly. The game also shows no slow down rate no matter how many characters or items are on the screen at the same time.  The sound is entertaining for a while, and it is different for almost all of the 16 courses, showing wonderful compositions with goofy sound added noises at parts.The gameplay is also great. You may pick one of 8 characters to race with. On a small go - cart, you must race on one of the 16 courses and try to get in first. There are many modes. You can race with a group of 8 racers in a grand prix mode, where you may race a total of 4 races and accumulate points. A vs. mode race will put you against a friend or 2 (or 3) in a single race. There is also a battle mode, which will put you against 1 to 3 other players where the last one alive wins.The items in the game play a big part. Some will boost your speed, while some are used to slow down enemies. Some steal enemies items, and some let you do things such as go invincible or invisible. Most of the however, are used to smash your opponents into the air and slow them down. In battle, it will be used as one of 3 hits to destroy the enemy.The characters are the typical mario game characters:  Mario, Luigi, Peach, Toad, Yoshi, Wario, DK, and Bowser. They should all come in handy sometime in the game, and it should be fun to test them all.OVerall, this game is great for having fun. I reccommend it to any one. Great for technology too. This game is right for you.\",\n",
       " \"This is a really cool game. I played this to death i don't know how many times, sometimes alone and at times with a partner.It's really tragic if you don't have this game when you own an N64, you don't know what you're  missing out on.Um...well, this game is pretty easy and you don't really  need a strategy guidebook for this one. I think the only reason why it's so  damn fun is because on every track and race, you can race it differently.  You can try new tricks or even attempt to create your own shortcut-if you  are that good!Graphics-wise, it's all a let-down, i was expecting  realistic models but i got cartoony characters, but then again- it's mario  and friends, right?As a mario fan- you'll want to have this in your  hands and if you're not- then play this as a party game. It beats Mario  Party in replay value but is somewhat less challenging.So bottomline-  it's a little too easy. But that will not prevent it from being a top 100  game of all time (read EGM #100)....\",\n",
       " \"This game is one of two reasons to buy an N64.  It's excellent multiplayer, with enough shortcuts and tricks to perfect that's it's also a great solo game.  If you have an N64 and you don't have this game, then you should stop wasting your time and go out and buy it.  You could play the other games, but they are terrible...\",\n",

The game has a cool unique to a racing game. it is tons of fun, and you can play either Mario, Luigi, Peach (The Princess), Toad, Yoshi, Bowser(King Koopa) & Donkey Kong. There are three types of trophies you can recieve, either the Mushroom trophy, Flower Trophy, Star Trophy and A Special Trophy. Cool Hu. Well this game was tons of fun i recomend it to everyone. Peace OutIf you liked this game then check out all of the Mario Games.\",\n",
       " \"Ahhhh! I love this game! It's so great. My friend gave it to me and I fell in love with it fast! I played Mario Kart for the SNES and thought it was the best thing since sliced bread. When I found out Mario Kart was for N64, I went bezerk. This was the first game to my N64 collection. You choose between 8 characters. You can get over 10 different powerups, including the legendary star which makes you invincible, banana peels which make opponents skid out of control, lightning bolts which makes characters small so you can smush them, mushrooms that boost your engine, and 3 kinds of shells. A green shell will go and bounce off anything, A red shell will do its best to find a character and smash them, and a spike shell with automatically find the player in 1st place and destroy them without fault. The reason it is 4 stars is because they didn't go the extra mile. If you play 1 or 2 player(s) you can do a Grand Prix, but not with 3 or 4. In player 1 mode you cant do a battle or do a vs. with the CPU. Battle only contains 4 tracks. I guess what i'm trying to say is that i wish it was more open. Taking shortcuts won't work because Lukita drags you back when your at the top of the mountain. This game would be the best if you were allowed to do more.\",\n",

It has a four player mode, which is not bad, but sometimes gets a little confusing when you're watching other people racing. The split screen should never be included. Although, that it is which is easy to get distracted. But Mario Kart is fun and it should be in one of the hand-held games, too. I wouldn't mind playing this. Oh, I have the one on Gameboy Advance, which is cool but not like the one from Nintendo 64. Now, that confused me.\",\n",

       " \"Mario Kart 64, the sequel to the first Mario Kart game on the SNES is great. Nintendo got rid of some of the things that made the SNES title so much fun, but added a lot too. The gameplay is much more enhanced, the characters look much better and the individual go-karts are very realistic.Like the SNES version, this game includes 3 modes of play: GP (Grand Prix), Battle, and Time Trial. In GP you choose one of 8 characters: Mario, Luigi, Peach, Toad, Wario, Yoshi, Donkey Kong, and Bowser in a large variety of courses in the Mushroom Cup, Flower Cup Star Cup, or Special Cup (which you unlike by getting gold trophies in each of the 3 basic courses) in 50cc, 100cc, or 150cc mode. 50cc is the easiest, but in 100cc and 150cc the computer gets much faster and more challenging. There are several items you can collect by driving through the question mark boxes which help you during each race. Lightning bolts (the rarest item to get) makes all of the other opponents small, mushrooms give you a speed burst, banana peels make one of your opponents crash if they slip on it, red shells are used to shoot directly at an opponent to get them off course, and green shells keep bouncing off the walls until it hits one of the racers. Unlike the SNES Mairo Kart game, there are several objects you need to avoid to stay on course. In different races there are trucks and cars that will make you crash if you hit them, snowmen that will blow up if you hit them, and many other obstacles in different courses.In Battle mode you and up to 3 others choose one of the 8 characters. You drive around a course trying to pop each other's 3 balloons. You can pop their balloons by shooting red or green shells at them or throwing banana peels at them to make them slip. You can also use the other items to avoid being hit by them. Once all of your balloons are popped you become a bomb which you can drive around the course trying to run in to the other players. This mode is a lot of fun, especially if you get tired of continually playing Grand Prix mode.In Time Trial mode you race in any of 15+ courses and try to set records for each lap and/or race.The controls for Mario Kart 64 are very simple and easy to master, and the music and sound effects are great as well.If you want a great racing game for your N64, I highly recommend that you check out Mario Kart 64.\",\n",
       " \"It's a classic, anyone that has a N64 should have this game.\",\n",

They are just small sound, but bring out some sort of livelihood.Value: 8/10 - Even though I don't have a Nintendo 64, if I did, I would probably buy this game because it is lots of fun to play. It can also be very strategic at times, which is good for a racing car game.Overall: 8/10 - Nothing too memorable, but it's delightfully entertaining to play when you are actually using the controls. Mario Kart 64 gives you things to do and stuff to work out. It's the first game I played on Nintendo 64 and as far as I'm concerned, it's well worth the time.\",\n",
       " \"This game is really fun, but I honestly enjoyed Crash Team Racing for the PlayStation a lot more. One thing that annoys me about this game is that you can't look behind you. I pressed every button and I can't get the camera to face behind the racer and this makes it impossible to shoot green turtle shells from behind without proper aiming. So nine out of ten times, I'm going to miss my target. How did Nintendo screw up this badly. And the racers are pre-rendered much like how Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong were in Donkey Kong Country for the SNES. I was wondering why wasn't it computer generated like Super Mario 64? It's still a nice little game, a little pricey, but still nice to have in your N64 collection.\",\n",
       " \"Mario Kart: 64.  It is such an improvement from the Super Nintendo version.  The graphics are quite detailed in comparison to the other 64 games out.  I would say, above average.  However, the graphics is not what sets this game off above the others.  It is the enjoyment level!Not only is it fun to compete with others like your family, friends, or even the computer player (AI) but it's got a great Grand Prix mode in which you can compete for a Gold Cup.  Get all gold Cups and you gain a bonus.The only complaint I have about this game, (reason why I gave it a four instead of a 5) is that the AI are too smart.  Races sometimes seem to be unfair.  You throw items at them, knock them to the side, speed ahead of them and it seems like whatever you do, it doesn't matter.  This can be frustrating.  Though the controls are WAY improved over the Super Nintendo version, it still is hard to control the carts (karts) around corners.Overall, this is an addicting game.Have a Super Nintendo? Buy Mario Kart for Super NintendoHave a Gamecube? Definetely buy Mario Kart: Double Dash for Gamecube.And finally, if you have a N64, Mario Kart 64 is one to deeply consider\",\n",
       " 'After checking GameSpot\\'s (author\\'s note: this was originally posted exclusively on GameSpot.com) and a few user reviews, I absolutely had to throw my two cents in. I couldn\\'t help but laugh when I read the introduction of \"Even with all its bells and whistles, Mario Kart 64 is very likely to disappoint you after about a week.\"When I picked up this game initially, my thoughts were \"SWEET! A new Super Mario Kart!\" I, unfortunately, never had an SNES of my own, so my fixes came in the form of time at my friend\\'s house.This game is absolutely spectacular in every way. Yes, I do feel that it could benefit from maybe a higher difficulty level and there is also the fact that it\\'s possible to clinch a Gold medal in a circuit (4 races) after finishing in the top spot in each of the first three races. However, other than these minor spots, I find it to be flawless. Everything from the graphics to the sound to the features are great. There is also a great amount of multiplayer available in this, with not only the up to four player split-screen, but the track ghosts as well. Track ghosts are saved data of your best race (single player only) on a course. The game saves not only your time but your entire race. When you race against your ghost, you can actually compare yourself second-by-second on the tracks and this also helps you to analyze spots and what you did to help you become a better racer.The items are what really make multiplayer fun, though. I\\'ve had many a time where I have something such as a ghost (which lets you steal and item and makes you invisible/invincible) while my friend had a lightning bolt (shrinks all opponents) and it\\'s a quick reaction race to see who can get their item deployed first. To me, however, there is nothing more satisfying than hitting your opponent (especially if it\\'s a friend instead of the computer) with a green shell (a shell that fires straight out, as opposed to the red homing shells) as he\\'s about to cross the finish line to win, not just the race, but the circuit as well. And, yes, I actually did that to a friend of mine. Talk about bragging rights.Up to this point, I have kept (or at least tried to keep) retro-rating out of this review and I was considering dropping one of the five rankings to a 9 because I\\'m stingy with giving out perfect 10\\'s. If I had rated this game when it first came out, it would probably be rated somewhere around 9.7 to 9.9. However, there is one reason, and one reason only, that I still own my N64 -- and that is to play Mario Kart 64 ... a decade later. (Note: I can\\'t even say that about Zelda: OoT or GoldenEye.) That, in itself, I think warrants the move up to the perfect 10 rating. ... I guess this pretty much means that I\\'ll have to give Super Mario Kart a 10 as well. I guess we\\'ll see when I finally get it on Virtual Console. (For those of you who ask \"Virtual Console? Why\" Read: paragraph 2.)Overall: 10Gameplay: 10Graphics: 10Sound: 10Value: 10Tilt: 10',\n",
       " 'I bought Mario Kart 64 for my nephew for his birthday. I played Mario Kart 64 when I was a little and I loved it. My nephew already has Mario Kart DS and he loves it. I figure that he will love this game too. Mario Kart 64 has many different levels in which you can race other Mario characters such as Luigi, Wario, Donkey Kong, Bowser and many others. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes any of the newer Mario Kart games.',\n",
       " 'This game is an old racing game but heck,its better then half of them out now.With all the crazy weapons,it can keep you goin awile.This game is really worth it if u have a nintendo 64.This is still 1 of my favorite games.',\n",

       " \"I got this game in '97 and it is still fun to play. Unlike the original Mario Kart for the SNES or the new Mario Kart Super Circuit for the GBA (both of these games you have to use a control pad to drive)you can use the control stick on the N64 controller ot drive your go-kart which is a hundred times easier than a control pad. The game is easy in the begining, but it hets much harder as you get closer to finishing it. The graphics are spectacular, and so is the music. In one course you can go off roading and drive around and look at Princess Toadstool's castle form Super Mario 64! The tracks are cleverly designed and all to often you'll find yourselft barely winning or completing a race. The game does offer a good challenge with eight drivers to choose from which onclude the following and their speed: Mario average, Luigi average, Peach average, Toad fast, Yoshi fast, Donkey Kong slow, Wario slow, Bowser slow. The speeds come to play in the later levels where only Toad and Yoshi are your best bet for first place. Again with the GBA and the Gamecube (which launched today as I am writing this) Mario Kart 64 is a must have for N64 owners who can't get the Gamecube or the GBA for now. Also each character has his or her own course and the game has race and battle multiplayer modes where in the battle mode each racer has three balloons arround his or her go-kart and everyone has to try to knock out everyones balloons.

After you get better you can move on to harder levels of play. once you beat the game on 150cc (hardest level) you can race al track in mirror mode (all tracks have opposite turns then their original tracks). the ads more replay value because the game in a sence has new tracks. All the tracks are unique and have varied difficulty levels. they are also well designed.The graphics in mario kart are bright simple and full of color. the music in the game is not very good but it does not mater because of the great sound effects provided by the characters.As with all great n64 games this one accells in the multiplayer department. It will appeal to people of all ages. you can choose from 3 different multiplayer modes battle championship single race. The most fun out of all of those is batlle because you go around getting items then try to hit your friends with any item you get. if you hit your'e oponent they'll lose a balloon they have 3 ballons.This is a party game i would recommend over any mario party game and definitly over didy kong racing. this is a classic n64 game no one shoild be without.\",\n",

       " 'Mario Kart is definetly the most classical game ever for racing. But maybe even the most classical game Nintendo has ever made.This game has three different levels. One is data which keeps track of your best time for the particular track and you get three mushroom guys who give you a boost up forward but there are no diamonds to get a specialty like a star or something.(I\\'ll explain about the special items later so you know what there for before you might play the game)In options you can see your data records for each track showing the best lap and the top 5 races in time with the particular racer on it(Not names instead they show. Mario, Peach, Bowser, Wario, Yoshi, Dk, Luigi, and my personal favorite which is Toad) ONLY DO FOR ONE PLAYER!Another one of the things you can do in Mario Kart is do Mario Kart G.P where you compete with all the other racers while picking your own. Before you start the screen will show 4 different brackets which have 4 tracks each and you pick the bracket you want. After each race it\\'ll show the score of each racer in points which goes that if you place 5th through 8th you get no points. 4th gets 1, 3rd gets 3, 2nd gets 6, and 1st gets 9. At the end of the of all the races the top three racers will stand on that olympic where it says 1,2,and 3 ranging as 1 the highest and 3 the lowest. After it shows the three racers om each of their spots it will show a trophy to you in bronze silver or gold and then  your player says something like \"YEAH\". Oh yeah their are diamonds in this mode.Then their is a single game which you only play one game against the computer or against friends at any course you or your friend wants to play at.Finally which you might\\'ve been waiting to hear is about the freaking DIAMONDS. While your racing their will be diamonds around and if you go through one it will show a box showing which specialty you\\'ve gotten. The long list of specialties are, one red shell which if you throw at someone within a certain distance they will fly up and back down making you get ahead. Also there\\'s a 3 red shell specialty where it shows three red shells going around your car and it does the same thing as 1 red shell would do. The green shells are totally opposite from the red one it comes in threes and ones and when you throw it will just bounce off the sides of the course back and forth going preety slow but preety much the only way you can hit another player with a green shell is if the racer is almost or is right in front of you. But the bowser shell which you dont get often but if you do get it you can throw it from anywhere and it will get the closest player ahead of you but if your in first place the shell is worthless. Also preety much everybody\\'s favorite specialty is the star where you can go really fast to catch up for about 10 seconds and if your it by anything it\\'ll just back off of you and you will stay up because you can do that the game also lets you knock people over if you headed straight at them and bumped them. Sorry if this is boring but if you want to hear about the game and you will buy it you should listen to the rest. You get bananas in 8\\'s and 1\\'s. Bananas you just drop on the ground and racers might crash into them and start slipping on the floor. The last specialty is ghost where nobody can see you and if a specialty hits you, you will just keep one going.My favorite mode is battle where you have to have 2 or more players. In battle their are 4 different modes. During battle you have 3 ballons with diamonds on the ground when you get hit you lose a ballon and when you have lost all three ballons you become a bomb to go get other players.  As a bomb you cant get any specialties but if you bump in to any racers you will be done as a bomb but that racer will lose a ballon. By the way computers can not play in this mode.This should be enough to know how this game is and I hope that you buy this game because you will probably like it.This game is a classic which I\\'ve said before.P.S (...)good bye and have a nice day!',\n",

Each character has their own racecourse (Peach's castle, Bowser's castle, Yoshi's canyons, Donkey Kong's jungle, and so on and so forth) plus more that are just fun and varied, like a beach, the desert, snowfields, and the Rainbow Road.You can play against the computer and compete for various cups, and each set of courses has various levels of difficulty.

In this game you can choose from 50cc - 150cc (which isn't much), and depending on your speed, this could be very boring, or the ride of your life.

The first time you go power sliding around a sharp turn, you'll see what I mean. The game is perfectly balanced- each character has strengths and weaknesses. Your skill determines if you come in first- not because you picked the best character. Oh, and I haven't even spoken about the brilliant course design. Every course has shortcuts, and special features, making them truely unique. The placement of the powerups is wonderful. And the multiplayer... Oh the multiplayer! One word: brilliant. Playing with your friends is exciting, competetive, and will have you laughing like crazy. This is what multiplayer gaming is all about.

Since the characters wouldn't look so great on karts in 3D on the N64, the sprites are in 2D, which explains how they are fully detailed.There are 16 courses you can race in, along with 4 courses for your average Battle Mode.Now that there are 4 players, the 2-4 Player modes can be pretty fun, especially 2-Player since it has all the options from 1-Player Mode.The item roster is slightly different from Super Mario Kart, but it's fun to use them all.Overall, Mario Kart 64 is another game that defines 3D gaming on the Nintendo 64.\",\n",

It is suitable for all ages and can be enjoyed and mastered by the young and old. 4-player simultaneous play with a selection of 8 classic Mario characters and 4 different difficulties (beat all curcuits in 3rd or better to earn Extra Mode) and 16 levels of play, each level containing it's own unique obstacles and course.\",\n",
       " \"This game is pretty darn easy.  I beat most of the tracks with only a rental.  It's not near as tough as the SNES version.  Heck, the SNES version of Rainbow Road had no walls around the track and the track was thin to boot.  Rainbow Road is a cakewalk on this one.  Wide the whole way with walls all around.  Too darn easy.  However, there is a monster shortcut that's very dangerous to go for if you want to make things interesting.Even though it was too easy, I bought the game anyway.  It's fun to beat the heck out of these computer controlled suckers.  Plus I really like the game's ending.There is one hard level, the one with all of the traffic in the extra mode.  It can be very frustrating if you make a mistake, because you get run over again and again and again.  It usually takes away any hope of recovery.The most significant improvement over the SNES version is the time trial mode.  You can race a ghost of yourself after you've already completed the course.  The ghost is only a recording of your previous performance, but it gives you a lot more motivation to beat your old time, I assure you.I've never been into multiplayer modes, but if you're into that kind of thing, you'll REALLY love this game.  Some multiplayer matches can go on for a LONG time, since the levels are so well-designed.\",\n",

To my amazment, the game came to the 64 with nothing but  crisp graphics and pre-rendered characters abound.  However, where there  comes the good side of all this, there is a bad side; some of the  characters in the game, in fact, cheat to win.  Now I'm not sure why this  little feature was allowed, perhaps to make it more challenging or give us  more reason to throw the controller at the wall when Mario suddenly jumps  out in front of you.  However, you can master there cheating ways by  learning how to outwit them at their own game.  Find shortcuts and other  things that can aid you in your race for the finish.  From cheating to  graphics and music I must say that the graphics are quite impressive for  such a game made so early on.  The music is also amazing, with hummable  tunes that will get you in the mood to race, or the mood to hit Wario off  the side of a moutain just to here him scream.  The sure thing to do now is  to buy the game, because it is a classic and always will be.\",\n",

You can play it by yourself, but to get the true experience of this game its best to play it with others. There is really no story line to the game, just a bunch of maps and characters to choose to race with. If you get bored of racing over and over again, there are several mini games, known as battle games, to choose from.

For those of you that have never played any other Zelda game, what are you waiting for? Now is a great time to start.Ocarina of Time is amazing. All the elements of classic Zelda are there - dozens of powerful items and weapons, lots of secrets to find, at least 10 new 3D-rendered challenging dungeons, plenty of secrets and side-games, and something that all the other Zelda's never had: a truly great story!If you enjoyed &quot;A Link to the Past&quot; you will most certainly like this game as well. The story of Ocarina of Time involves going back and forth in time, between a happy peaceful Hyrule, and a dark evil one, much like ALTTP; but don't think this is a rip-off on its predecessor. The complex dungeons, challenging bosses, and deepening story lines will blow you away. The 3D element of the game also adds so much more that was never possible before. Even the music is catchy and well orchestrated. (I actually downloaded the mp3 soundtrack online!)The gameplay is a little tough to get used to - afterall, you've never played Zelda in 3D before - so you actually have to consider things sneaking up behind you, and flying overhead! But once you get used to the controls and learn to use the &quot;Z-Targeting&quot; feature (using the trigger button will solve just about any control problem you may encounter), the gameplay gets easier.The only thing that annoyed me was Navi, a little fairy that travels with Link throughout the game. She is always bugging you to give you painfully obvious information. I suppose she is a helpful guide for younger or more inexperienced players, but I found her annoying. But once you come to realize that Navi is an important aspect of the game's control, you will let it slide.I would recommend this game to anyone who owns an N64 console, and even more so if you enjoyed SNES's &quot;A Link to the Past.&quot; I can't wait to play the sequel when it comes out.\",\n",

Being able to play as young link and adult link in two similar, yet in a way completely different worlds as one would find out sooner or later.  The graphics are still, and when this was released, it was the best game graphicwise as well.  The bosses are easy, yet in a way challenging, and the dungeons and temples are amazingly designed.  However, there are two faults, one minor, one somewhat major.-Link is missing the strap on his frontside that holds his sword case thingy!

       " 'I\\'m not really a fan of N64.  I\\'ve always been more of a Playstation one fanatic, but Zelda is undoubtedly the best game that I have ever played.  If you think that Final Fantasy is good, then Zelda will make all of the installments in final fantasy look like junk.  There\\'s only a couple of games on the nintendo N64 console that of which I liked, and that was Gauntlet Legends, Super Mario, and Donkey Kong.  But this game beats them all by a longshot.Then why did I give this game four stars instead of five?  The reason is because of the...problems listed below.1.  This game is HARD. I don\\'t mean hard as in \"Challenging\" I\\'m talkin\\' about the whole you-possibly-will-never-ever-complete-the-game-without-a-strategy-guide hard.  The type of frustration which can rack your nerves big time.2.  There are a couple of glitches in the game. Example: I dare you to cut a sign with your sword.  Then play Zeldas lullaby with your ocerina of time.  The piece of sign which you had just sliced and diced will float.  That\\'s just one of the glitches.3.  A little confusing, as far as the story goes.  It\\'s better to play the game twice and see if you still understand it.4.  Replay value isn\\'t very high.  Once you complete it, that\\'s it.  It\\'s so hard that I wouldn\\'t ever want to go through the same frustration again, as to the fact that it was very difficult, even if you do know what you\\'re doing.Okay, those were the bads.  Here are the goods.1.  The graphics are outstanding.  Wow.  The whole world of Termina reminds me of middle earth, only a lot less dark and ten times more exotic.2.  Once you beat the game, you feel satisfied with yourself.  Sure, this game is a little short, but it will still take you a long time to beat it, no matter how experienced you are with gaming.3. The plot is good and twists a lot.  I know that I said it was kind of confusing, and it kind of is, but it\\'s still fun and the things that of which I did understood surprised me a lot.It\\'s sort of a mystery.4.  Fluint and absolutely excellent cut and FMW sequences.  It\\'s true.  Like I said above, the graphics are wonderful.  And plus, exploring a small portion of Termina, which you do through out the game, is an experience that you don\\'t wanna miss.5.  The bad guys are challenging, but not so challenging that you\\'ll be ripping your hair out.  Once you beat them, you feel satisfied.6.  Highly addictive gameplay and plus you won\\'t stop until you beat the game.But there\\'s one major, and I mean MAJOR problem with this game.  This game is so addictiive that you might forget about everything else in life.  Remember your family?  You won\\'t when you get this game, since you\\'l be wanting to play this game even more.

For one, the player is given a very challenging and extremely satisfying quest to undertake. The game plays across a vast world with different subsections, each with their own particular themes. The gameplay is easy to get used to and becomes second nature as you play through the game. Graphics and sounds are done extremely well, considering the cartridge space allowed.There is not much to complain about, as this game really showed players what the N64 was capable of.

There were some early on copies with a song/chanting in the fire temple that got taken out in later copies because some people got offended by that and the mirror shield (I have one such copy) but even with that in mind, it's still an amazing game with great music and it sort of ties all of the zelda games together like a central hub.

Then I realized it was a Zelda game. As a huge fan of A Link to the Past, I thought \"ZOMG that looks awesome! I need to get this more than I\\'ve ever needed to get anything!\" I remember reading about it in GamePro and obviously being interested, but that commercial sealed the deal. I knew I had to have Ocarina of Time, and that Christmas, my mom got it for me. Cheers!A lot has been said about OoT over the years. It has been referred to as the \"Best Game of All Time\" by some, and the \"Most Overrated Game of All Time\" by others. I\\'m not really in either camp, but I lean closer to the former group, I suppose. If you haven\\'t played it yet, you should. It\\'s out on a variety of platforms and there\\'s even remake of it with better graphics, but I would still recommend the N64 version if you want the same experience people had back in the 90s when OoT was THE GAME you needed to play.Story:You are Link. The Great Deku Tree, guardian of the forest in which you live, has summoned you. It\\'s revealed that you must visit a far off castle and meet a \"Princess of Destiny,\" and doing so brings you square into a struggle for the fate of Hyrule -- nay, the world -- itself.Gameplay:To complete your quest and save Hyrule, you must boldly enter into many dungeons which are filled with fierce skeletal warriors, human-sized spiders, horrible ghosts, and... immobile venus fly traps! Completing a dungeon gives you an item for the main quest, and completing all of the dungeons will allow you to face the final boss. There\\'s much more to it that, but I\\'m trying not to spoil storyline specifics for those who haven\\'t played it.Hyrule is a vast world. One of your in-game guides tells you that \"You can go wherever you want.\" That\\'s true, to a point. There\\'s a lot of exploration in Ocarina of Time. The game is always trying to point you toward a certain place, but whether or not you go there is often up to you. In an interactive world such as Hyrule, you can do many things. Why go see what\\'s on Death Mountain when you could pour water into all of the soil patches in Hyrule? Or why go play the Shadow Temple -- which does not have any attractive Gerudo women -- when you could go to the Spirit Temple, which does? The exploration is one of OoT\\'s best features, and it\\'s probably better than any Zelda which came after it.Controls:They work well enough. You don\\'t have the full on camera control that some of the later Zelda games give you, but personally, I never found it all that essential to the process.Ocarina of Time introduced a \"Z-targeting system\" for aiming at enemies and talking to non-playable characters. What you do is get near an enemy/NPC, press or hold Z, and then press a button to talk to them/attack them. The system pretty intuitive and well made, so much so that its successors have yet to really improve upon it.Music:*90s gripe* Where is the classic Zelda overworld theme? Oh, we can hear it for like five seconds in the Hyrule Field theme? ARE YOU SERIOUS? But seriously, the music is pretty good. The Hyrule Field theme which I just mentioned is a good theme. The music does a good job of fitting the areas which you visit, for the most part.Some later Zelda games use too much ambient music in the dungeons. OoT is guilty of this too, but only to a small degree. Apart from the Water Temple\\'s melody, there\\'s nothing that makes me want to relax and do some meditation or whatever while hearing it. :POh, and I\\'m sad to report that the \"OoT Commercial Music\" is not in this game... :(Replay Value:It\\'s pretty massive. You can do some Temples in different orders than you did your first time through, or you can use different items to progress through the Temples. I summed it up in a sentence, but there\\'s hundreds of hours of replay potential there in just finding all of OoT\\'s possible variations.Like in the original Legend of Zelda, you can do the \"Three Heart Challenge,\" which means you can complete the game without any of the health upgrades from beating a dungeon. Essentially, that\\'s playing Hard Mode (although it isn\\'t really that hard).But if the Three Heart Challenge wasn\\'t enough, OoT lets you tack on additional stipulations to make replaying it even harder! There are technically unnecessary items which let you breathe underwater and resist intense heat. Not getting them limits the amount of time you can spend in relevant areas. On top of all that, you could even as far to skip the health upgrades which halve your damage.______If you call yourself a gamer and have not played Ocarina of Time, what are you? Some undercover non-gamer sent in to infiltrate us!? Go play it now!',\n",

This game is truly one in a million that I am sure any person can enjoy, BUT, if your a Zelda fan (and have played all if not most games from the beginning) you'll notice some of the things in OOT are recycled. For example, the Kakariko town music is completely recycled from Zelda: A Link to the Past. In fact this game borrows a lot from Zelda: A Link to the Past, though they do manage to change some things in OOT here and there.

       " \"Reading magazines from 1996-1998 one thing you couldn't escape was a some kind of mention of Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. It was all over the place. Popping this in my N64 when I took it home I spent literally 2 hours just exploring Kokiri Village just cause it was so fun. But then I realized &quot;oh yeah there's more to this, isn't there?&quot; And that's when the fun started.Graphics: Although you can probably debate this, this has one of the best graphics you'll find on the system. Lot of areas just drop that &quot;wow factor&quot;, like when you first enter Zora's Domain or the game's many cutscenes.Sound: Although there's no voice, except for Navi's annoying &quot;Hey!&quot; and an occasional &quot;Hello&quot; from her or Link's grunts, it's got some awesome music. One thing I love is the short ocarina songs you play, such as Song of Storms, Zelda's Lullaby and Song of Time, plus general area music. Although the overworld music isn't like what it was on Link to the Past, it's still great.Story: The story starts off with Link having a bad dream about a mysterious man and woman. Then Link is summoned to the Great Deku Tree where he fills Link in on his quest and it goes from there. Even though it can be a quite simple story, it's just a huge epic story that kept me interested.Gameplay: The infamous Z-Targeting system that's spawned several developers to use it in their own games. The recent Star Fox Adventures uses this. Your C-Buttons are for your weapons. B is your sword and A is your action button(Talk, Jump, Climb,etc.). You'll know this system by heart cause Navi tells you how many times about it within the first hour. Camera is excellent and the Z targeting helps.Even though you might be able to find this, I suggest you pick it up. Dust off your N64 and dive into what is one of the 90's most critically acclaimed and commercial masterpieces ever.\",\n",
       " \"This is by far the best Zelda installment yet. Much more fun than Majora's Mask, mainly because you can freely explore the world of Hyrule. (see review of Majora's Mask)This game can be fun for anyone.\",\n",
       " \"I confess- i've never played a single Zelda game before this- cause i wasn't into RPG games, but i'm so glad i never gave this a miss. One day, i  just felt like playing this game and i bought it and it's terrific, no  maybe better than terrific, it's too good to be true.I spent 4 good  months playing this game and i finally beat it recently but that hasn't  stopped me from planning round 2 and buying the brady guidebook to find all  the secrets.This game is also filled with charatcer interaction and  drama. I think you can read Amazon's review for the storyline and i'll just  encourage you to buy this game if you haven't.It's a player's choice  game and coming from Nintendo- i am not surprised it's this good. I'm gonna  get Majora's mask when it comes out this winter and i hope to see this game  on the Dolphin.If you are hooked and want to relive the magic- go get an  old NES or SNES from your cousins or someone and buy the previous Zelda  games and you'll see why Zelda's a classic.Like Mario, Zelda has a huge  following and blah blah...i don't need to elaborate on the game's success  anymore.As far as fun/gameplay/story/graphics/sound/replay is concerned,  it's a safe bet to say that i will give every category at least 9.5 out of  10.I'll only give it a 10 when they put in FMV and put to rest once and  for all, that Zelda is the definitive standard-RPG and action-RPG and not  Final Fantasy. Sorry guys, i had to say it- it's true.Now if only  Majora's Mask would arrive sooner...oh i can't wait!\",\n",
       " \"The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time is a definite Classic. I've owned this game for a good 6 years and it's just extraordinary and fun, but at the same time educational. In this game you must do alot of thinking and find out where the secrets are. So in other words, it's a magical adventure game.The graphics are actually good (for it's time) and the gameplay is easy to get used to. The controls are also simple and the whole storyline is just well thought out and I can definitely tell that they put alot of time into this game. In my opinion it's the best Zelda game so far.Now I will tell you the beginning of the Story so you can even feel more excited about getting this game.As a young baby boy, your mother was killed by an evil person. Now you have no home and have to move to a place called the Kokiri Forest. This is a place where people never grow up and aren't allowed to leave the forest. They're called the Kokiri. But you're different. You really don't belong in this forest, instead you belong out in a world called Hyrule. You're a Hylian (normal people who actually grow up). You're out there to defeat Ganondorf. Ganondorf, most likely the person who killed your mother, is a strong and evil person who wants to take over Hyrule and become the King. The only person that can stop him is you (Link). Now the question is, will you be able to defeat the mean and evil Ganondorf and save the world of Hyrule?If you think (or know) you can take that responsibility, then I suggest that you buy this game along with the N64 (if you don't have one) and experience something very special. Like I said, it's a definite Classic and will keep you entertained for hours on end! You won't regret it!Thank you for reading and I hope I was helpful enough.\",\n",
       " 'the game was awesome. Zelda has always been an addicting, mindblowing, and fun game. Many people like it. The game features a great 3d world in which there is night and day. the game also has many different enemies and dungeons and the famous ocarina where you can play different tunes that you have learned. A really good game if you like action and adventure. The frustrating thing are the puzzles. they may take some time to solve. This is not why i gave the game 4 stars. I believe 5 stars means the game is perfect. and this game is not perfect.',\n",

       " 'This is one of the best games I have ever played.  Even shooting the arrows is fun, you can actually use your shield to block getting hit.  Just incredible.  The only bad thing I can possibly say is you almost have to buy the strategy guide or else you will likely get stuck on some levels.  There are a few dungeons that I could not find my way out of without buying the guide.  But overall great game!!',\n",
       " 'Zelda: OOT is centered around a massive, circular field called Hyrule. Around this field are pathways which lead off to various different locations such as dungeons, castles, villages, volcanoes, etc... Each path will lead to usually one destination like a castle, and once explored, you travel back across Hyrule field and visist another pathway which leads to a different location. This makes areas more accessible, and it makes backtracking as less tedius as possible, due to the fact that you\\'re not endessly travelling through pre-explored ares. Backtracking is an important feature of OOT, due to the fact that when you progress through the game you aquire objects which give you the ability to explore areas more thoroughly ... bombs for instance blow up walls that hide secret paths. Hockshots give you the ability to ascend to higher ledges. The Ocarina of Time opens secret doors. Thus, pre explored areas which you thought were unimportant can in fact conceal the most important instruments and dungeons in the game. This is compounded, when at one point in the game you aquire the Master Sword. This is a special sword which, upon claiming, makes you and the world age by seven years, and by doing the reverse, putting the sword back in it\\'s mold, makes you and the world 7 years younger. The good thing about this is that the past and future are profoundly different. The future is controlled by evil, whereas the past is controled by good. Needless to say, your mission in the game is to liberate peice by peice the future world from the evil Ganondolf. However, in order to do so you must travel back and forth in time creating situations which will have an impact on the future world.A main part of this game is the ocarina of time. Depending on what tune you play, the ocarina will turn night in to day, make it rain, open secret doors, or make blocks disappear, amoung other things.  This adds an important layer to the game, for you have to use your brain in order to work out which song is necessary to progress. For instance, after spending hours wondering what to do, the idea could suddenly hit you, \"Should I play Zelda\\'s Lullaby in front of the waterfall?\" If successful, the waterfall will stop and a passageway will display itself, thus giving you a tremendous satisfied feeling. The actual songs you learn in the game are some of the best songs in computer game history. In fact, only Computer World by Kraftswerk can compare to the greatness of the music in OOT.By the time Zelda: OOT was released the difficulty in games was just perfect. Your heart was racing when you met a worthy adversary, you were fustrated when you died, you were delighted when you succeeded. Fustration and anger are both necessary in games because it\\'s those feelings which make you truly delighted when you succeed...  Unfortunetly, since OOT, games have become so easy that a huge part of the joy in completeting them isn\\'t there anymore.',\n",
       " \"I have to say this is the absolute best Legend of Zelda so far...  But there is one thing I have to clarify THIS IS NOT THE FIRST LEGEND OF ZELDA!!!

You can also find 99 Gold Skullutas! Play an Ocarina! Controls are flawless!One of the greatest games of all time. Don't play it-live it!PS. Why has Amazon combined OOT and MM into one? It's confusing, and it's depleting the rating! Also, Gerry Atrick, the reviewer above me, was that troll review even nesscery? You said to contact you  if anybody knew how to get out of the Deku Tree. Well, 1: Look on a gaming site and 2: How can anybody contact you if they don't know your address.

       " \"Zelda &quot;occarina of time&quot; is much like the rest of the Zelda series... it doesn't disappoint! With really cool items to collect and using your songs/spells to warp around, the entire game offers whole new dimensions.Things such as a horse you can call and run about the world, play carnival-like games to win power-ups, collect hard-to-find items such as the two-handed sword (which is better than the master sword, but you can't use a shield), magically powered arrows, and more!This game is fairly easy to beat, but finding everything will take you much longer!\",\n",

       " \"The most recent LoZ games, in my opinion, have all been fairly average.  Wind Waker was the latest actually good LoZ game.  But of all the LoZ games, OoT is just plain incredible.In this game, you play as Link as he grows from a child into a young man while on his quest to defeat Ganon and save the world from ultimate, evil rule.  Along the way, you meet many friends and face amazing boss battles.The graphics (at the time) were just incredible.  It really made me enjoy looking at and playing the game.  Nintendo really did a great job in this department.The gameplay is like no other.  One of the few incredible games to utilize the C Buttons for vital controls, this game felt really comfortable to play, and there's tons to do in the game besides just beating it.  Also, throughout the game, you are forced to travel back and forth through time and play as Young or Adult Link to complete the game, which is awe-inspiring in my opinion.  Sadly, after doing little everything, there's no addictive mini-games to really play and not much else to do, but go through the game again and again.The sound is incredible, and the music has never been better.  I found myself turning the volume on the TV all the way up while playing this game, because the sound was that good!If you're an avid gamer, yet you've never played this game, then something's really wrong with you.  Pick this game up and play it 'till your fingers fall off (which I guarantee you'll do).  This game is worth buying and owning for as long as you even are alive.\",\n",
       " 'The best game for the N64. if you are to have 5 games for the system it needs to be Mario 64, Mario Kart, Smash Bros, Banjo Kazooie, and Zelda',\n",

       " \"Wow... What can I say. As I'm writing this review, the popular  consoles right now are ps2, gamecube, and xbox. I have all of those. Yet no game on any of those systems are better than this. This is probably the best zelda ever(I have yet to buy the one for gamecube). Deciding between this and Majora's mask is a tough call, but I think this one gives a little more gametime.How should I begin to describe this game? It's deep, engrossing, and the graphics are spetacular for a N64. Yes the newer games right now definitely have better graphics than this, but this game beats all of them in terms of gameplay, music, and theme. The story is old, but hey, it's a classic formula. Why change it? What would Zelda be without dungeons? This is one of the few 3rd person games I've played with great controls. The z-targeting system can change a traveling mode Link instantly to a combat alert, and maneuverable Link. The music fits the moods perfectly, from the dark shadow temple to the light and cheery music of the lost woods, it's great. Buy it, it's worth your money, and it's probably the best game ever for N64.\",\n",
       " 'The legend of Zelda has always been a series that continually delivers amazing games that are at the top of their class.  The legend of Zelda has always been my favorite video game series of all time since I was little and their games continually suck away hours of my life.  This is the game that made me truly love gaming(Before I just did it for fun).  It also set the stage for other great games such as majoras mask, wind waker, and twilight princess.Gameplay:  If you have played any of the other Zelda games, you will know that you play as Link, a young Kokiry boy who must go out on the adventure of a lifetime to defeat the evil Ganondorf and save Princess Zelda.  The controls are flawless.  You just move the analog stick to make Link move, move forward and press A to roll, press B to use your sword, the C buttons are home to you other weapons such as the bow, hookshot, and the like.  This game introduced the revolutionary lock on system where you just pressed Z, and staid locked on to an enemy, which meant no more aimless sword swinging, it realy made the combat more managable, and much more fun,  Like any Zelda game there is a huge overworld to explore.  You have grassy plains, tall volcanic mountains, serene lakes, sandy deserts, difeerent towns and villages, and lots to do.  The overworld is just enourmes, esspecially for an N64 game.  Hyrule feild stretches in all directions.  One of the great things about traveling is part way through the game, you will get a trusty horse named Epona.  Riding around hyrule feild is just realy addicting.  There are many great minigames to do as well, such as the shooting gallery, bombochu bowling, selling mask, and fishing, yes fishing.  There are also special task to do such as collecting ten special poes(Huge ghost that appear in hyrule feild), or collecting 100 Skulltullas(Spiders of a horrible curse).  The meat and Potatoes is of course the dungeons.  Each dungeon is completley uniqe and different than the last one and shows off alot of great elements.  There are many challenging puzzles that reward you when you figure them out.  You raise and lower water, look for paths that are invisible with the lens of trooth, push giant blocks with the silver gauntlets, use the megaton hammer to push blocks, and much much more.  Each dungeon is just very well crafted that it is hard to beleive that it came out in 1998.  There are many feirce enemies in each dungeon that fight to put an end to your quest such as Stalfos, bats, lizolfos, armos, iron knuckles, jellyfish, tektikes, readeds, skulltullas, and so many more.  The boss battles are each intricitley desighned and completely different than thre last in the way they look and fight.  The boss battle with Ganon at the end is one of my all time favorite final battles ever(only rivald by the fight in twilight princess, and Mother brain).  The difficulty is always just right with the challenges and enemys getting toupher as you go on.  Through the game you get alot of fantastic weapons to use, such as a bow, hookshot, megaton hammer, hovor boots, silver gauntlets, boomerangs, and much more.  Each is always put to good use and none of them ever go absolete and are awlays usefull the whole way through  One of the big mechanics is of course the ocarina itself, you play it manually with the button layout being like the holes in the real thing.  You can change day into night, transport across the world map, and open passage ways with you trusty instrument, and much more.  The biggest suprise is after you get the Master sword and travel forard in time seven years.  Time travel is a huge element in this game as some things you do as a child will effect the things you do as an adult, and vice versa.  there are also different things avalible to do in each time and it is a blast to go between two time periods and it realy makes you feel powerfull.  Nore matter which aspect of the gameplay I am talking about, I cannot find fault anywhere, absolutely perfect.Story:  Hyrule was created by din Nyrule, and Farore, they left behinf the triforce which lies in the Sacerd realm.  Many years later, an Evil Man named Ganondorf seeks the triforce and Places a curse on the deku tree, and does other horible things to many races .  The deku tree tells navi, the fairy that she must awaken Link as he has been having a nightmare about the evil man.  Link goes to get a sword and Sheild, and goes to see the great Deku tree who asks him to rid the curse.  Link succeeds but finds out that he is far to late.  Before dying, the Deku tree tells him the legond of the triforce and gives him the spirituall stone of the forest, the Kokirys emerald, and then tells him to go to hyrule castle to meet nPrincess Zelda.  Link goes to hyrule castle, meets princess Zelda Who tells him of the dreams she has been having about Ganondorf and Ask Link to get the other two stones, Link obliges and gets them but finds that it is to late As princess Zelda and Impa flee hyrule catsle, Zelda throws him the Ocarina of time.  Link then comes face to face with Ganondorf and gets a taste of his power.  Zelda then Telapethacally teaches him the song of time.  Link goes to the Temple of Time and Plays it at the alter where the stones are placed and opens the secret chamber where he finds the Master Sword.  Link being the legendary hero, takes the master sword, but finds that he has fallen into Ganondorfs trap.  He is then seald in time for seven years where he is awakened by the sage of light Rareu.  Link discovers that he is now an Adult.  and instructs him to find and awaken the other sages.  This is where the game gets epic, but I wont spoil anymore fore, suffice it to say it is a great story that is very well told and will keep you wanting to find out what happens next.Graphics:  These graphics were truly groundbraking and ahead of their time back in 1998.  The moment you step out into hyrule feild and se the scale and distance you will be mesmerized.  The game shows off some fantastic day and night sequences as well as many different colors.  Hyrule market looks and feels alive, the kakariko village will look like a town with houses and shops.  The desert esspecially is arguablly the best way to show off the N64s power with snadstorms and wind effects.  The Charecter models are great for Lnik, to Zelda, To Ganondorf, to the bosses, to even the NPCs.  The enemys realy look feirce and different.  These graphics truly set the standerd in 1998.Sound:  The sound effects themselves are Spectacular like the flowing water, the clank of a sword hitting a wall or an enemy, the enemy sounds when thay are struck bu the sword or when they are attacking, Lniks yelps, and much more.  The game features a brilliant musicalll score, Koji kondos work is reminiscent of John williams almost, and that is not a comparison I make lightly.  You will hum the beat of the lost woods, love the powerfull melody of the temple of time, be entranced by the song of storms, there is just so many great melodys that I have lost count.  The song of time is truly memorable as well as all of the others.  My only complaint might be the lack of the traditional overworld thing and Navis annoying hey listen screams, but these are all tossed aside once you hear Koji Kondos work at its finest with the lost woods theme and song of time.Replay Value:  I still play this game nonstop.  It truly proves that Amazing agameplay oulives any other aspect of a game.  There is just so much to do and so much to see and so many places to explore that you will never want to drop the conntroller.This game is My favorite game of all time and is a must buy for any N64 owner, or enouph of a reason to get one if you do not have one already.  It is also avalible on the Wii vertuall console and is well worth the download.  This is the game of my Childhood and I cannont stress enoph how much you need to get this game.',\n",
       " 'I got this game a couple of years ago and I was completly shocked, it was really fun and addictive but takes you into a new world called Hyrule. Throughout the story, Link has to save Hyrule from Ganondorf who makes Hyrule look like the Devils mountain! But, if Link collects the right items, he might save Hyrule with the Princess of Zelda.Graphics: 5/5 The colors really standed out with the houses, grassland, people etc!Gameplay: 4/5 It was a challenging game, might be hard to follow through in controlling but Z-targeting helps you alot! Using new weapons such as swords, sheilds, bow n arrow, hookshot, etc was usfull in beating.Storyline: 5/5 The story was copied by the old Zelda from Super Nintendo but made into a more better world. More places to explore, and more side quests to do!Overall: 5/5 My opinon, I thought it was a game that everyone even Zelda fans should get it for your collection. Once you beat it, you can actually go for more side quests, items to get, and other things you missed.',\n",
       " \"A Good game comes along, entertaining millions of fans worldwide. Then, a year later another good game comes along and steals the fisrt ones place. Ever since the beginning of game history, every good game that came out eventually got replaced by a better game the next year. Since Sept. 98, that cycle has been broken, stopped by one game that never got replaced, even by it's sequals, nothing ever ended out better than Zelda: Ovarina of Time. This game has revolutionized 3D gaming with its Z-Target system. It has enchanted and bewildered people with its magnificant storyline. It has taken the lives of thousands of people because of all the side-quests and collectible items in it. This game, I am predicting, will probably still rain supreme until the next system comes out (The one after gamecube). Its Z-Targeting system makes Link (the main character) look at an enemy, within this looking, he can circle around it in stategic patterns, accurately aim and strike the sword without missing and hitting air a yard away, and eaily and quickly dodge and backflip attacks. Many games, even nowadays, imitate this system, but fail to get it as correct and perfect as Zelda did/does. The storyline starts off telling of a magical forest with many never-growing children in it. All these children have one compainon fairy with them, except one boy, who does not. Right from hearing this setence in the game for the first time, you know your in for an adventurous, complicated yet slightly realistic storyline that will take your life for at least a month. And, this game has many, many side quests to do. There are 100 special spiders to defeat and get treasures with, 50 magic beans to be planted and give a passegeway to unaccesible areas, 25 heart pecies to collect to get a whole lot of health with, 15 masks to sell and play around with, 6 empty bottles to collect, a chicken to rais, and a huge trading sidequest that eventually leads to the possesion of the strongest weapon in the game. And much more. This game also has the perfect sound to it. The cheerfull, happy nature of the magical forest can be perfectly heard in it's background music. The adventurous, wide and far meadows of hyrule feild are perfectly expressed in it's background song. The fast-paced and action-packed lives of the desert theives is clearly expressed in it's song. Everywhere you turn in this game, you are greeted with a new background song that sings perfectly the attributes and unique features of that place, and transations perfectly with whatever the player/link might be doing in that place. This game's sequal, Majoras Mask, suffered horribly from the lack of this. And the prevous games in the series didnt meet this either. One more thing though, I'll admit it to the world, I hate the main Zelda theme. I'm glad its not in Ocarina of Time, In a game that so clearly stands out with it's music, one old sounding, bland song that dosnt fir well with hyrule feild wouv'dv ruined the experience of going out of kokiri forest and seeing it for the first time. Oh, I forot to mention that part too, the game has a perfect attidude for adventure in it. The places are designed very well, and when mixed in with the fabulous background music, gives a feeling of adventure that is completely unparelled to any other game, whatsoever. The first moment you walk out of the small and cramped kokiri forest, which actually used to seem so big, onto the your first grasses of hyrule feild, the sun will blind the screen for a moment, and as rising, reveal this spectacular, wide open feild with a tuft of trees, a monstor here and there, a ranch in the middle, and a clear blue sky with a brightly shining sun. Along the feild, a rise in elevation starts, as you climb the hill, you can see even more than you could before, a magestic, huge catsle, a winding clear blue river, a deep valley, a menancing volcanoe, and a huge lake, along with a tuft of trees, and a monstor here and there. As you travel to new places, you will feel almost the exact same feeling of adventure too, when seeing the towering windmill of Kakariko village above the small, humble houses of the village below it, with the perfect backgrond music for example. With this great feeling of adventure, huge enviroments, much huger than even the ones of nowaday games, and a great storyline and absolutly stunning soundtrack, Ocarina of Time is the Greatest game of all time, until a greater game will come out, wich will probably take a very very long time. If you dont already own this game (Shame on you), you should buy it immediatly, and while waiting for it to ship, download an emulated version. Now. Or else.\",\n",
       " \"This game is just sickeningly good and nothing else since has matched it's gameplay, depth, charm, design and atmosphere. It is absolutely flawless and perfect.When it came out 3 years or so ago i was hooked to it immediately and i finished it in about a month. But since then i finished it around 10 more times and i still enjoy playing the full game today after 3 years! It is that good. The controls are absolutely perfect and the targeting system works perfectly for most combat situations.The atmospehere of the levels of the game is just the best ever in a game to date. For example in the mysterious forest the Lost Woods, u can actually feel it's mystery from the excellent music getting louder as u reach it's source and the way the whole place is designed.No videogame fan has an excuse not to play or own this. Words cannot describe my love for this game. (Sounds stup[id but it's true) You will so nostalgic even when u meet the characters again for the 20th time. It is just a gaming masterpiece and i doubt it will be bettered for a veeeeerrryy long time to come unless the new gamecube zelda follows the same direction and improves it with a larger interface and new fresh ideas.BUY IT it or u will miss out on the best game ever. yes the best game ever..  all i can say is if u havent for some reason BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT...\",\n",
       " \"Zelda 64 is defenetly one of my favorite games for the N64.  It has a fairly good story, it's interesting enough to make you want to know what happens next, and it has a gameplay that's unbeatable.  The combat system is very simple and great.  You have your z locking on system which makes killing enemies a piece of cake.  There is so much to do in this game that it's comaprable to a good RPG, something that N64 hasn't been blessed with yet.  The graphics are pretty good, especially since they don't use the expanssion pack, and the world is just huge.  One down side is that some puzzles in the caves can be pretty tough, and sometimes, you may feel lost and don't know what to do next. The bosses look very impressive and get more challenging as you progress through the game.  This game will defently take a couple months to beat, unless you play 24/7.  After you master the game, then it'll just take a couple of days, like any other normal, or great game.  Nintendo has defenetly done a great job with this one.  One thing I didn't like about it is that it has gotten eaiser than it's predicessors. I've started playing Zelda games since the SNES days.  Back then, it was Zelda: A Link to the Past.  The game was tough.  I'll admit it, it took me a year to beat that. That game was also HUGE.  But now, 3D has made things eaiser, which I like and don't like.  But another thing I don't like.  They keep on changing the whole story of Zelda. Those of you who played the SNES game will know what I'm talking about.  There, Link didn't live in a forest, and there wasn't a guardian fairy.  And the whole world changed too.  Well, maybe it's for the best, but I wouldn't mind if they made a remake of it, maybe for the GBA?.....\",\n",
       " 'I came across this game in 1999 and immediately recognized it from the cartoon from back in the 80\\'s.  I played it just to try it and I wound up getting so addicted I had to buy it for my N64.  I would stay up til all hours playing it.  It\\'s rare for a game to hook me like that but this is one that is challenging yet fun so you can\\'t help but say \"okay I\\'ma try one more time then I\\'m turning it off\" and still be playing a couple of hours later.The Water Temple was the biggest pain for me because I tend to rush into things and wouldn\\'t do things right as far as the puzzles went.  I loved the Forest Temple as a kid.  The weapons are easy to use and play a role in a fair share of what you do.  The boomerang has a few uses such as getting items that are out of reach, hitting switches, and killing enemies.  The ones I loved were bombs except when I got too close to them.  lolI don\\'t remember much else about the game since it\\'s been a while since I had time to play it.  I do know it took me quite a while before I managed to get some things such as all the Poes and Golden Skulltulas but no matter how many times I play this game it doesn\\'t lose its appeal.  Like I said, it\\'s challenging but not so hard that you throw the controller down in frustration and give up.It\\'s the second easiest game of the three Zelda\\'s I\\'ve played.  Twilight Princess, although very in depth, was easy and Majora\\'s Mask was the hardest but only because I kept running out of time when doing certain tasks.  Ganon was hard for me to kill at first but I think now that I\\'ve played it enough and therefore fought him enough I know what to expect and I can now anticipate what he\\'s going to do and react accordingly.All in all, I recommend this game even if the system it was made for is pretty much a thing of the past.',\n",
       " \"This is a game you could fall in love with. When I first played it (immediatly after it came out) I was so engrossed and enchanted with it that it was like the real world disappeared and there was just me and the game. This never happened with me with a video game before. The scenery is breathtaking and some of the music scores are beautiful, although I think the music in the first forest dungeon as an adult is absolutely creepy! The dungeons are puzzling at times but not too hard, and the bosses are challenging enough you may have to try them several times, but don't worry you can eventually beat them. The game has a built in save feature so you don't need a memory card and you can save anywhere in the game, don't have to wait for any specific save point, that is real nice.You start out as a 10 year old boy and then after 3 levels you travel through time and become an adult. Hyrule has changed and you need to save the land. You go through many levels and bosses to finally get to Gannon, the ultimate evil here. He is an improvement on the previous Gannon of previous Zelda games(looked like a little pig then!) and fighting him is more challenging and engrossing in this new game. There are other little side adventures thoughout the game to entertain you when you want a break from dungeons and monsters. This is a high quality game fun for kids and adults.\",\n",
       " 'Wassup, fellow gamerz!  Nubs.  Lulz.My parents just bought me \"The Legend of Zeldo: Collector\\'s Edition\" for my 14th birthday. It features this \"Legend of Zeldo: Oracana of Time\" game. I enjoyed this game very much...even tho the graphics suck! I will give you some of my thoughts now!My favorite part was when the main character, Link, pulls the Supreme Sword from the stone in the iceberg temple. Oh man! Glammondwarf (the villain) was so cool! He snuck into the Secret Realm behind Link and stole the Trueforce of Strength!!  Pwned!The Prince Zeldo person was really weird.  He/she was a tranny who turned into some guy named Shaieke, who kept stalking Link on his journey. Then he/she would change back into an elf girl in a dress. What a creep!  But Zeldo had the Trueforce of Smartness, so I guess that character was okay. Zeldo had this tall white-haired ninja lady named Inca as a bodyguard. Inca might have been a man too though...I\\'m not sure.  She looked kinda like my aunt Helga.The Link character was really cool!  Link wears white tights, a green toga, and had a grappling hook device! He also has this little firefly thing called Navely that follows him around! You begin the game playing Link\\'s little kid brother, which kinda sucked.  I can\\'t pwn Goombas with a little midget (Goombas are these big skeleton guys).  I think the kid brother is supposed be Peter Pan, after he killed Captain Hook and left Neverland (maybe they have another game about that part).But later you get to play Link, who is an adult elf with a pointy nose. He has the Trueforce of Braveness, so that means he is very brave. He can throw dynamites into walls to blow them up and reveal secret buried treasures! I wonder if the treasures were hidden by magic pirates?  Later on, Link gets the Bassoon of Time and can play it to make it snow! I think Link is kinda mentally handicapped though because he never talks. He just goes \"Ugh! Hiyah! AUGHHHHHH!\" and stuff.I think he might be a cannibal (or vampire) too, because he eats hearts to gain health. There is a really annoying beeping sound that reminds you when it\\'s time to feed.You pick up these little colored diamond things called rublees that you can use to buy stuff with. But they look really big, so I wonder how Link can carry so many in his pockets? And if you don\\'t pick the rublees up soon enough, they begin flashing and disappear! I guess they\\'re like...big holograms or something, like in Star Wars.  Why are there so many rublees hidden in the grass and under rocks? I really wish I could mow my parents lawn in real life and find money like that.There are these fish people named Zurros. They have this giant jellyfish named Mr. Jabba Jabba and you have to go into his stomach to retrieve an ugly little talking fish-man! I think it was the Zurro king\\'s pet and he lost it. But you have to carry it all around Mr. Jabba Jabba\\'s stomach, so it\\'s kinda annoying.Then there are these big rock guys called Gordos that like to roll down mountains! They are my favorites because they live in this mountain called Doom Mountain. It explodes like a volcano and tries to kill you!  Holy ****!That evil Glammondwarf guy is a member of the Garundo thieves. They are a bunch of ginger women that live on a beach. But they don\\'t have any men in their race, so I don\\'t understand how there are so many Garundos? Maybe some of them are trannies, like Zeldo.  I think Glammondwarf might be one. He kinda sounds like a drag queen when he laughs.Sooooo all of these people live in this magical land called Hirole with a bunch of weird cartoon characters. I think it\\'s supposed to be kinda like Toon Town from Roger Rabbit. It\\'s such a huge place! It takes forever to ride across it on Link\\'s horse, Ramona! That\\'s right! You get a horse! Link steals it from Mario and Luigi at some ranch. So I guess Link is kinda a thief. Maybe he\\'s really one of those Garundo thieves? He does kinda look like a girl.  But he\\'s not a ginger, so I\\'m not sure.Aaaanyway....play this Bassoon of Time game! It is full of so much WIN!  I hope I didn\\'t give too much of it away!  Lulz!!11one  XD-w00tkid95-',\n",
       " \"The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is, simply put, the best adventure game I have ever played. I'm a newcomeer to the Zelda series, so I'm not too sure how Ocarina rates with the others, but I love it. For an Nintendo 64, the graphics are absolutely beautiful. The lighting rivals that of a Playstation 2 or Xbox or Game Cube. The sound is terrific. Each different sound effect was done in detail. The sword against stone and the sword against wood are not the same as in a lot of games and sound just like they should. The echos when you enter the room and the monsters roaring in the distance are incredibly realistic and Link's footsteps are done perfectly. The puzzles are challenging, but not so that you want to through the controller down in frustration but so that you won't put the controller down until you've figured them out. The minigames and the sidequests will keep you playing long past the time you've beaten the game itself because they are so plentiful. The controls take some getting used to but are perfect for the game's combat system. The targeting especially helps the later you get into the game. The music is captivating and is very well done. Overall, I think this is one of the best games ever, not just in adventure. It's definetly a game anybody with a Nintendo 64 should have.\",\n",
       " \"WHat a game.  I have played Zelda For Nes, Snes, and now the N64  A link to The past was a great game but this is the best Zelda game.  The graphics are graet.  Teh temples are huge.  This is the best game for the N64.  Majoras mask is great too but this one is better.  Sp i reccomend this game to everyone.  It truly is one of N64's best.  Can't wait to see Zelda on Gamecube\",\n",
       " \"I love this game! You can't say that you are a Zelda fan, if you don't own this game. This game features an awesome storyline, unforgettable characters, and just keeps getting better. You could play this game forever, and not get tired of it! If you have a N64 system, you better own this game! Or if you have a Gamecube, you should have the Legend of Zelda Collectors Disk!\",\n",
       " \"Unless you've been living in a box your whole life, chances are you've heard about what an incredible game this is. Nay, I will go as far as to say perfect. Even if you haven't grown up with the Zelda series, you're still likely to find this game quite enjoyable. It's safe to say that this game was nothing short of revolutionary, and it continues to be one of my favorite video games of all time.The story begins as a young Link awakens in a small tree hut. Staying true to past games, you start off with no items or weapons. You soon learn that the Great Deku Tree wishes to see Link, and thus you set out to explore Kokiri Forest. Upon taking your first steps outside, you meet the elfish inhabitants of the forest. While you search the area for a sword, you have time to get accustomed to the controls and the environment. Once you have sufficiently explored the forest and gathered the required items, you head for the Great Deku Tree, accompanied by your faerie friend Navi. After completing this first dungeon, the Deku Tree explains the history of the Triforce and rewards Link with the Spiritual Stone of the Forest, thus setting the story in motion.The graphics of this game are fantastic for its time. You can now journey through a fully navigable 3D map. The details of the environment properly capture the mood of each setting, be it a forest village, a watery temple, a haunted underground maze, or the inside of a giant fish's belly. The map of Hyrule is pretty expansive and full of places and objects to explore. The cinematic sequences look great and tie the segments of the story together well.I absolutely love the controls in this game. Everything is pretty intuitive: the A Button is used to execute actions, the B Button swings your sword, and the C Buttons allow you to store up to three items to use during play. You're able to roll and jump, swim and climb, block attacks, stab, and build up power for swing attacks. But the greatest addition to the control features is the Z Targeting ability. This function allows you to lock on to people and enemies and focus a particular action on the targeted object. Moreover, this button will focus the camera directly behind Link, allowing you to have control over your point of view. To this day, I compare games' camera controls to Ocarina of Time, often wishing for that very desirable Z Targeting capability. A great addition to your supply of character controls.The story itself builds upon previous games in the series, for we interact with familiar characters like Zelda and Ganondorf in addition to many new individuals. As always, there are a whole variety of weapons and items to collect during your travels, some that are familiar and some that are new to this title. What makes this game even more engaging is the idea of traveling through time. You begin the story as a child, growing as a warrior and searching for the Spiritual Stones. When you travel into the future, the world has become darker and your missions more challenging. There is a constant interplay between the past and the present as you try to make your way through the dungeons and numerous side quests. The multitude of puzzles, games, and items to collect makes this story very immersive and entertaining. The endearing characters that you meet provide for a rich, enjoyable plot, furthering your adventure along with their dialogue and aid.And the game would not be complete without sound. Again, Ocarina of Time gains a perfect score here. The sounds that Link makes when he fights, moves, and interacts with others are both enjoyable and believable. The echoes that your character makes are varied depending on what type of environment he is in. Likewise, the soundtrack is just as appropriate. Each level has a different musical score, and each song blends in beautifully with the surroundings. Also, some of the songs are familiar tunes from the previous games, transformed just right for a sound that is nostalgic, yet new. The ocarina songs are appealing as well, adding another interesting component to the gameplay. Ocarina of Time really has a wonderful soundtrack, and even today I still enjoy listening to it.All in all, this game is truly a classic, and yet another impressive sequel in the Zelda series. From the sensible controls to the superb storyline to the awesome soundtrack, Ocarina of Time is a gem in the adventure game genre.\",\n",
       " 'simply the best.  great story, great graphics, great control, great replay value.  it is true, n64 wasnt that great of a system, with pretty horrible games.  i bought it back in 98 and up until i got my ps2 i only bought a few games for it,  Zelda: ocarina, Zelda: Majora, Goldeneye, Perfect Dark, and DK64.  There may be other good games but this game is by far the best, not just on n64  but possibly out of all video games ever.  trust me people, if i say it is good, it is good.  I dont give out good reviews very easily.',\n",
       " \"The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is really awesome, but how awesome? Is it the best of the Legend of Zelda series so far? Oh, undeniably, but that is not the point. My point is that it was the best game for the Nintendo 64, with Super Mario 64 and its direct sequel, Majora's Mask in a second place draw. It shows how the franchise began. Link sets off on a journey to save Hyrule from the evil Ganondorf for the first time. He meets Princess Zelda on the way, and when she flees from Ganondorf, she leaves the Legendary Ocarina of Time in Link's possession. He uses it to travel through seven years with the help of the Master Sword. The graphics were neat for the time, the storyline was really exciting, and there is a lot of stuff to collect. The dungeons were challenging, and the boss fights are neat. If you are a fan of Nintendo, please pick this up. You will be glad you did.\",\n",
       " \"With almost three years in the making, how did The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time stand the test of time itself? As a prequel to the entire Legend of Zelda series, it has caught heavy anticipation. Ocarina is a prequel to the events before A Link to the Past. Link is a child, whose destiny is to save the land of Hyrule from Ganon (Gannondorf here) by traveling through time. You'll meet up with other characters in the adventure and interact will fellow Hylians, Kokiri, Zoras, and other civilations who aid you on your quest to save Hyrule. Ocarina of Time is one of those controversial games that the series has carried all along. In the end, the game is an Action/RPG, and should never be classified in the style of traditional, turn-based RPG's (like Final Fantasy).New additions to the series are automatic jumping and Z-targeting. The emphasis of the Zelda games has always been puzzle-solving and dungeon arrangement. You also build your attributes, receiving items including the Ocarina, learning songs whose purposes range from teleporting to opening doors to time traveling. Along with mini-games, hidden items and side quests equal, its a worthwhile experience. Graphics-wise, Hyrule never looked better and most effects in Ocarina of Time are outstanding. No need for sharp visuals and smooth framerates, but rather focus on detail and designer talent. The real-time cutscenes and the passing of day and night are impressive. The sound also holds its own on this cartridge format. The themes of Zora's Domain and Gerudo Valley are music to the ears. Zelda fans will remember tunes of Kakariko Village and Zelda's Lullaby. A big plus is that all the sound effects from previous Zelda games have made a comeback.In the end, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time makes the cut. Even though the gameplay consists mainly of dungeon-dwelling and puzzle-solving, the impressive graphics, quality sound and everything that's been obtained from previous Zelda titles will keep fans and non-fans alike entertained. It's fun.\",\n",
       " \"Ok, I figured I'd throw in my opinion as well. Mainly, this review is for people who have not played the game yet and are wondering if they should. Perhaps you aren't too into RPGs or whatever, so it is my job to convince you! First off, it's more of an RPG/adventure combination, since it doesn't use conventional RPG techniques like turns or experience. But that is a good thing, because the way the game is structured allows for near-total freedom as you play it. Yes, like some people have said, you must beat the dungeons in a certain order, but there are about a million other things you can do whenever you want, and that just expands the boundaries of this game even more. It is truly the greatest game I have ever played, that is no exaggeration. The graphics and the sound are wonderful, the puzzles are NOT as easy as some people are saying -- the Water Temple is maddening! -- and the character development and depth of play is unmatched.Majora's Mask is almost as good, but what makes Ocarina of Time better, in my opinion, is the fact that it is sort of the &quot;ultimate&quot; Zelda game, meaning it starts from the beginning and recreates the entire story of Link and Zelda and Ganon, and it is a completely stand-alone and definitive game. Majora's Mask, on the other hand, takes place right after the events of Ocarina of Time and has a very different structure. The three-day cycle you must live through makes for an extremely enjoyable game, but the only downside is you can't take your time and relish everything like you can in Ocarina of Time.Either way, though, Ocarina of Time is a beautiful game.\",\n",
       " \"The best game I ever play.  In fact, I beat this game in a week.  It's a good deal and is worth the money.(big time)\",\n",

It's nice and long (like all the other Zelda games) It has a perfect level of difficulty, there are so many different weapons in the game, there are so many memorable dungeons and fields in the game, well, I could go on forever. I wish I could give this game a higher score than the measly 5-star rating Amazon.com forces me to give but alas, i cannot. If you own a Nintendo 64, BUY THIS GAME RIGHT NOW! If you don't own an N64, you can still buy it for gamecube, it's the same exact game. I own it for both N64 and Gamecube. If you like this game, then buy the sequel too! It's called Majora's mask. I'm telling you, you will definetly not regret buying this game if you are a die-hard Zelda fan... Or even if you are not a die-hard Zelda fan. Although I don't know who would be reading a review of a game that was made in nineteen ninety-something, in 2007...

Yes, the  game was a little difficult, but if you whine about how you couldn't get  past the first level, either gain some skills or do not enter the arena  with true gamers.  If you did not play the original Zelda you will not do  well with this one.  This is by far the greatest Zelda of the series and I  can't wait to see what the future hods.

Well, at least to me it doesn\\'t. I\\'ve seen a few 1 star reviews about people bashing the game only because it\\'s no \"everquest\" or \"Halo\". This game is so good that you don\\'t compare its style or graphics with something in today\\'s modern gaming. This is an old school game. You just don\\'t compare old games to new ones. I believe there\\'s a favorite for every generation. This one happened to fall into the N64 genre, when gaming was really starting to pick up. And honestly, you think over 700 5-star reviews were written all by children? We were children when we all played the game! And looking back as adults now we cherish it as a classic and one of the best in videogame history. Kids that didn\\'t get to exprience the NES, SNES, and N64 missed out on a great gaming genre and though the generation of gaming today is awesome there\\'s nothing on the classics.Ocarina of Time remains my favorite game of all time, even before some of my new favorites and there\\'s nothing like turning on that N64 and playing over and over again.

I didn't know much about Zelda, and had only played very few games before, but was mesmerized by this game. The beginning of it is so magical and imaginative; it really draws you in to the story. I found myself playing through the beginning of it over and over again because I didn't have my memory card yet. This game takes place in a vivid fantasy world that is vibrant, ominous, beautiful, and haunting. I had never experienced anything like it. To this day I have never been so absorbed by another game.What's really impressive is that this whole game is very consistent. The music is also exceptional. The music is better than most movie soundtracks, in my opinion. All of it perfectly accompanies what is happening in the game. So much happens in this game; it has a lot of cinematic scenes too, which really develop the story, which is an excellent tale of good versus evil.Ocarina of Time stimulated my imagination at a young age more than just about anything I know of. There are a few films and books that would come close, but I can't think of anything that could quite surpass it. Ocarina of Time is an involving, authentic, scary, and epic adventure. Playing it for the first time makes for an unparalleled experience.\",\n",
       " \"This is one of the best games!  You have to play it.  It is definitely the best game in the Zelda series so far.  It has adventure, romance, mystery, and SO many subquests.  It's about a boy named Link who has a destiny.  He lives in Kokiri Village, a little tiny village in the land of Hyrule.  Anyway, a little fairy named Navi comes and says that he must meet the Deku Tree.  He does and the Deku Tree tells him to go inside the Deku Tree and destroy all of the evil monsters inside him.  Link does this and the Deku Tree gives him the Kokiri Emerald, or the Spiritual Stone of Forest.  The Deku Tree phrophesies that Ganondorf, an evil desert Gerudo man, is trying to get hold of the Triforce, the essence of life in Hyrule.  But in order to get hold of the Triforce you have to get three of the spiritual stones.  Unfortuantely, after the tree's prophecy, he died because of the curse Ganondorf had cast upon him.  But Link and Navi go on their journey and get the Goron's Ruby, or Spiritual Stone of Fire and the Zora's Sapphire, or Spiritual Stone of Water.  Link gets the Ocarina of Time but when he opens the doors Ganondorf gets in before him and he gets the Triforce.  Link waits seven years in the Chamber of Time and when he awakes he's all grown up.  Rauru, the Sage of Light is there and tells him that he must save all the Sages from their temples and receive the medallions.  He receives the Medallion of Light, Forest, Fire, Water, Shadow, and Spirit.  But the game.  It's definitely one of the best N64 games around!\",\n",
       " \"There comes a point when sooner or later one has to admit that they have reached a mile stone. This is it. Look no further than the game that changes everything that went before it. Yes, certainly other games can compete graphically with this, but innovation is an entirely different proposition. Zelda, then, innovates on an unparalleled scale. Weather, night/day, age, all real aspects which merely touch the surface of this monumentous achievement.To be really honest, there is no real weakness with this game. No puzzle will stop you in your tracks. There is ALWAYS something to do. In fact it will take you a lot longer to find everything the game has to offer than it would to finish other games. And this is where the distinction comes in. You can label this as an adventure game if you like. But, it is beyond comparison with everything else. Thus meaning that it should be catagorised in a genre by itself. Or at least as a game that redefines an entire genre.There are no comparisons. Forget other inferior games that try and emulate and 'better' this. Forget the games that rely on pretty visuals to impress. Zelda has all these and so, so, much more. Buy this, it is that simple.\",\n",
       " \"Classic game. A favorite when I was a kid. Still fun to this day, I just wish the graphics were better! Got to remember this game is from 98 and one of the first 3D games of it's time! Great game.\",\n",
       " 'The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of time is an incredible game and is one of my top ten games of all time, but it is neither the best N64 game or the best game in the series. It is the second best of both. The best N64 game is Mario 64, and the best Zelda game is the Wind Waker. That said, this is one of the most innovative, most fun, and most interesting games of all time. The overworld is HUGE, there are a ton of items and weapons to collect throughout the game, and there are plenty of interesting enemies and bosses to fight. Ocarina of Time is a true classic.Presentation- 90/100Graphics- 98/100Sound- 96/100Gameplay- 99/100Replay Value- 96/100Overall- 97.5/100',\n",
       " \"I remember all the hype surrounding The Legend Of Zelda: The Ocarina Of Time like it was just yestarday. The Zelda franchise has always been among the best to grace any video game system, and with the power of the soon-to-be-released Nintendo 64, the series was finally going to reach its next step: the third dimension. This (along with other titles like Super Mario 64 and Mario Kart 64) got both gamers and the press excited about the N64 and the upcoming Zelda game. While the Nintendo 64 never quite managed to live up to all its prerelease hype, The Legend Of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time managed to not only live up to its respected hype, but in many ways surpass it.What makes TOOT special IMO is the fact that it is the first game (that I've played) where you truly feel like a part of its world. Many games tried hard to accomplish this feat, including previous Zelda titles, but TOOT was the first game to finally get it right. Even the later Majora's Mask never quite managed to create the immersive world TOOT did.Much of the game's feeling stems from the interactivity of its world. You can spend hours exploring a certain area and still have not seen everything there is to see. For example, many of the game's locations have these hidden holes you can jump into and find hidden goodies (as well as hear some pretty haunting music). Once you obtain the Stone Of Agony, however, you find out that these randomly placed secrets are only the beginning. I won't go into too much detail here since you need to play the game for yourself to really appreciate it. Another thing that makes this game feel more realistic than previous Zeldas is character interaction. Remember how decidedly generic a lot of the NPCs in Zeldas II and III were? In TOOT, each and every NPC is given at least some sort of personality so that you can easilly distinguish him/her from the rest of the game's characters as well as once again feel like you're a part of Hyrule. And of course, the third dimension (the dimension we live life through) helps the game a great deal.The gameplay is equally great. I especially liked how you can hold three items at a time rather than just one, which is especially helpful in the game's dungeons which often require you to use several different weapons/items. Speaking of which, the dungeons have some of the most clever puzzles and interesting layouts of any game I had ever played. And I really liked how once you completed all the puzzles in a dungeon, you opened a new path from its starting point straight to the final boss, rather than simply having to run through the entire dungeon all over again after death the way you did in previous Zeldas (this was especially annoying in A Link To The Past, where the dungeons were much longer and more challenging than in the original Legend of Zelda). And of course, the game's graphics are among the N64's best (not necessarely because of how detailed/realistic they are, but how carefully crafted and full of life they are), and the soundtrack is among the best ever to grace a video game (even with the Star Fox 64-quality midi samples).In brief, The Legend Of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time is an excellent game. If you own an N64 and have not already picked this game up, I strongly suggest you do. If you do not even own an N64, than the system's worth picking up just for this one game and its semi-sequal Majora's Mask.\",\n",
       " \"This last year of 2003 ET did a survey about the best video game series ever. Zelda one there poll and this game is one of the reasons why.Ocarina of Time tells the continuing story of the Zelda universe. In the Zelda timeline it takes place before the other games. As usual you are the hero Link. You must save the princess Zelda. You have different quests you must finish and many obstacles that will block your way. The story is that Ganondorf the evil wizard is trying to take over the world. Equipped with the Ocarina of Time you will travel time in your quest to save Zelda, Hyrule, and the world.This game is jam packed with stuff to do. I'd say you have a garunteed 40 hours of gameplay. It has all the classic Zelda weapons and more. You get to ride a horse across the country side and do some impressive underwater work. There are just so many impressive factors.I love this game. I can't thing of words to describe how good it is. If you have an N64 your collection is not complete until this game is put in it.\",\n",
       " 'Let me put it like this, if I had to destroy every videogame I own except one, this is the one I wouldn\\'t destroy. This is simply the greatest game ever made. I\\'m not going to insult this game by trying to describe the storyline or graphics etc.. You have to experience it for yourself. Most helpful thing I can do is tell you how you can get to play this. This game has had dozens of ports. One came on a bonusdisc for Gamecube with \"Windwaker\" in 2003 and another came in a collectors edition (Master Quest) also for gamecube. If you can\\'t get ahold of one of these, the original for N64, or a ROM you should buy a Wii and download it from the Wii Virtual Console. It will be worth the while.',\n",

I won't give anything away, but I almost cried at the end.  And the music is great.  You will find yourself humming the Gerudo theme song.  I highly recommend this game, but I suggest you buy a strategy guide even if you normally play this game without one...It's really hard and you will probally get stuck in the water temple just like everyone else...I had to start over about three times.  But the replay value is good, too. That's why I give Zelda 5 stars!!!\",\n",

       " 'Back in the late 1990s I wrote two articles for a now defunct game website about \"Ocarina of Time\". One is a review of the title, and the other is the how in many ways Ocarina of Time feels like a remake of the eternal SNES classic (and my personal favorite Zelda game), THE LEGEND OF ZELDA: A LINK TO THE PAST. Rather than leave them unposted, I issued them on Amazon back in 2007, one article on the \"Collector\\'s Edition\" (\"Zelda 64 a Remake?\" and and one on the \"Regular\" edition (an actual review of the game). When the 3DS version came out, I wrote a review of that and included both articles on the review as well for bonus content. Originally this review only featured one of the two articles - I am now putting both articles up.Mike London, 9-9-2012-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------This commentary on \"Ocarina of Time\" was written as a gaming article for a retro-gaming site back in May of 1999.  I was going to post it on Amazon but for some reason never got around to it.  Mike London, November 3, 2007Article 1: Does \"Zelda 64\" really live up to all the hype?[Blurb: With all the hype, its hard to be objective about OoT.  Is it the best game in the series, or does it have to settle for second (or, egad, third?) best?  Is it like Star Wars Episode I, all special effects and no substance?  Find out a few thoughts from a fellow gamer!]The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is easily one of the most hyped games of recent gaming history.  In fact, I think I could safely say it IS the most hyped game yet.  There is only one thing that can compare to it in terms of hype, and this product is in an entirely different industry.  Star Wars: Episode I had the same amount of coverage.  Being a big fan of both, of course I\\'ve beat the game and have seen the movie.  And they have one thing in common.  They\\'re both eye candy.  But how do they hold up to the rest of the series?  In my opinion, The Empire Strikes Back is by far the best Star Wars movie.  But what about OoT you ask?  How can I defame such an instant classic?One reason mainly.  In the original and in The Legend of Zelda: Link to the Past, (I can\\'t speak for Zelda II because I haven\\'t beat it yet) the ending was spectacular.  Not the game ending, for The Legend of Zelda was produced in the Stone Age and there was much ending wise, but the last dungeon.  Ah, the last dungeon.  Only recently (like December 23, 1999) have I beat the first quest of The Legend of Zelda.  That last dungeon on Death Mountain was a killer, a true challenge that you had to match your mettle with to get past it, save Princess Zelda and beat that nasty ol\\' Gannon.  It was truly a great dungeon.  Now skip on past those five years between the release of the original and the SNES version.  What have we here?  A dungeon comparable to that in the original Legend of Zelda!  Everything is bigger and better in the SNES version, including the last dungeon.  Whew, and I thought the original was harder, but no way!Then, in 1993, we see the release of the Game Boy version of Zelda.  The Legend of Zelda: Link\\'s Awakening was released to a very receptive crowd.  But guess what!  No end dungeon!  In terms of dungeons, this is the smallest of the Zelda titles (again, not including Zelda II).  You beat eight dungeons, and then you go and beat the Wind Fish.  Personally, I\\'m half a dungeon away from completing this Zelda game (Dungeon Seven, which I completed half of, went and beat eight, and now I\\'m back on the last half of VII).  That last dungeon was challenging, granted, but what about that classic end dungeon?  No where to be found here.  Granted, it\\'s a Game Boy game, and it is huge for that consol.  So that offence is not to serious.  And we did get a new dungeon, though not the ending I was hoping for, with the Colour Dungeon on DX, which was the rerelease of the classic game for Game Boy Colour.After five long years, The Legend of Zelda: Orcarina of Time was released for the N64.  So cool!  Link in a 3D adventure.  About time too.  Mario, the cash cow counterpart to Link, got his 3D adventure way back in `96.  Of course, I bought the game.  And of course, I beat it.  It is an excellent game.  Truly it is one of the great classics.  But one flaw keeps it from edging out The Legend of Zelda: Link to the Past.  The end dungeon absolutely sucked.  That is my only disappointment with that game.  As I was nigh the close of the Shadow Temple, I was really looking forward to getting into Gannon\\'s tower.  I was expecting a great closer dungeon, just like in Link to the Past.[Spoiler: If you haven\\'t beat the 64 version of Zelda, don\\'t read this]What did we get?  Instead of a great closer dungeon, we got a door way that was blocked by barriers.  What did we have to do?  Go thru six rooms and beat whatever was in them, then go and shoot the barrier corresponding with each temple to open the pathway.  And what did I get?  A great disappointment.  Sure, this might have been a good way to end a novel or something, but to end a Zelda game like that was horrible.  The Game Boy was forgivable and acceptable, but this ending to Zelda 64 was truly despicable.  That has been my biggest disappointment with the Zelda series.[Spoiler Finished]Others say The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is the best Zelda game.  I have to disagree.  Don\\'t get me wrong.  It is easily one of my favorite games of the N64.  It\\'s a great game, very innovative (espically that nifty Z Targeting feature) and an epic in its own right.  But for what the system is capable of, The Legend of Zelda: Link to the Past beats it out of the coveted title of Best Zelda Game.  LTTP is huge.  It fully utilized the SNES technology.  It had a full twelve dungeons, two of which the sole purpose was to beat the bad guy, and not try to retrieve any medallions or crystals or pendents or pieces of triforce or what ever.  That\\'s one more than the original has.  (LoZ has one closer dungeon for each quest.)  After you beat the bad guy twice, you go and fight Ganon.  There were plenty of side quests for an SNES Zelda also.  Overall, for the system\\'s capabilites, LTTP is my favorite.But what about The Legend of Zelda: OoT?  My two chief complaints are these:1.  Weak closer dungeon (as I spent a good time detailing up above).2.  Not enough bad guys to kill in the Overworld.All other Zelda games, including the black sheep of the family (Zelda II), has plenty of bad guys to kill in the Overworld.  But what have we in OoT?  A few measly skeleton dudes at night, and some giant flying plants that you can hardly get too in Hyrule Field.  Give me the old Zelda with bad guys streaming at you in every new screen.  For all the time they put into it, you don\\'t think it would be to hard to correct this problem.Then we come to another mistake Nintendo made in the N64 version of Zelda.  Granted, LoZ had two main tracks, one being the Overworld theme and then the dungeon theme.  They could have had more variety, but it was back in the Stone Age.  That Overworld Theme became pretty much the theme of the entire series.  And guess what they decided to omit music wise from OoT?  The Overworld them from the original LoZ!  I couldn\\'t believe they did that!  Hopefully we\\'ll see it in Zelda Gaiden.  Maybe the Triforce will show up in that game too.  Just a thought.Now, after railing on OoT for a great majority of this article, you may think I hate the game.  Quite the opposite, really.  It\\'s a great game, and worthy to be in the Zelda Series.  (Gee, it sounds like I\\'m defending Zelda II, which I\\'ve already done in a separate article).  But it has been the single most hyped up game in the history of Nintendo, and it is totally out of balance.  Great 3D game, but would have been better had it corrected the problems I stated above.  It\\'s a fun game, and I had a great time beating it.  It provides a lot of enjoyment.  But, just like Star Wars: Episode I, it just can\\'t live up to all that hype?  I wonder if any game (or movie) could actually.[May 9, 1999.  An article originally written for NintendoLand.com.  I\\'ve written four released articles and one unreleased article (dealing with SMB 2).  It will have to be edited.  Also, perhaps incorporating part of the structural symmetry article.].....--------------------------------------------------------------------------Article 2:[Originally this was written for a retro-gaming site back in early January, 2000. It has never appeared on Amazon.]Zelda 64 a Remake?[Blurb: Zelda 64 and SNES Zelda has several similarities, almost to the point that the basic game design of Zelda 64 is a remake. Read here for more information on this intriguing phenomena! Just a few thoughts from a fellow gamer!]After playing the course of The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, I\\'ve noticed something very intriguing about it. It seems to be a rehash of what I feel is the best Zelda game: LoZ: Link to the Past. Why do I say this? I say this because there are several structural symmetries that lie between Zelda 64 and LTTP.Lets examine it. For one, there are three pendants you have to acquire in LTTP. This is after you go and rescue Zelda and leave her at the temple. Well, this time around, you don\\'t rescue Zelda, but you do go and talk to her. After that, when you get the three pendants, you go and she is kidnaped. This is after you get the Master Sword in the Lost Woods. In Zelda 64, you go thru the first part of the quest, getting three spiritual stones. After you get those three spiritual stones (which I think the tower on LTTP is much better than that d----- Lord Jabu Jabu\\'s belly. I hated that dungeon! =)), you go to the town. Guess what, as Link approaches, there it cuts to a cinema, and Zelda is kidnaped by Ganondorf. Hmm . . . haven\\'t we seen this story before? It turns out that you have to get 5 of the Sage\\'s medallions. Rauru conveniently gives you one, so we can cut the sixth one away. Only by getting the six sage medallions can you open the bridge to fight Ganondorf. How intriguing.In the superiour SNES Zelda counterpart, it is seven crystals, and you don\\'t get one given to you. Link wakes no sages this time. Instead, the seven maidens of the wise men descent have been hidden in deep dank dungeons, and Link has to transverse thru 13 dungeons all together, 5 the first part, and eight the second part. They are challenging, fun, and intriguing. Granted, Zelda 64 has some great stuff. But it is not as consistent as LTTP. After you have gone thru the seven dungeons (two more than in Zelda 64), you now have all seven crystals. That\\'s great! Now, go to Death Mountain, and by doing so you will open the way to Ganon\\'s big bad temple.Okay, what do we have in Zelda 64? You go and get the five medallions, plus the one that Rauru gives you as Link. Guess what? Now you have to go to his tower, and open the rainbow bridge with the six medallions.* Hmm . . . isn\\'t that what we did in SNES Zelda? Why, I do believe it is, Watson!Another issue yet addressed is the Light World/Dark World. Zelda 64 does the same thing, save this time it is time traveling (I\\'m not even going to go into the impossibilities of time travel on this . . . that\\'s a whole separate article in itself). In SNES Zelda, you have a little mirror the old man gave you. There are eight transporters located thruout Hyrule, transporting back and forth. If you are in the Dark World, you can use the mirror to go into the Light World, making a temporary transporter. Well, in Zelda 64, there is no mirror or transporters (the closest to a mirror is the Lens of Truth, found nigh in the Shadow Temple). But if you go and put the sword back, then you go back to being young. That creates two versions of the same world to explore. That structural symmetry corresponds to LTTP. Not only that, but at the end if the first three stones, Link goes to the Temple of Time and gets the sword. This is after the three Spiritual Stones goes into place. Hmm . . . isn\\'t that what happened in LTTP? After getting the three pendents, Link goes to the Lost Woods and retrieves the Master Sword. But he cannot do that until he has all three pendents. Well, that\\'s the same in Zelda 64. He can\\'t get the Ocarina of Time, now can he retrieve the sword, until he wins the corresponding three spiritual stones. I swear I\\'ve played this game before . . . . ; )The real question is why did Nintendo do this? Well, Miyamoto is a great gamming god, but as far as stories go, his team is not that good at having connecting story lines that make sense. Again, another article, another time. The structural symmetries lying between Zelda 64 and LTTP is quite frightening. Who knows why they chose to do that? Granted, the story line is different, but quite a few of the fundamentals behind both pieces are indeed the same. In review:A Listing of Structural Symmetries between SNES Zelda and Zelda 641. SNES: First Part, Link goes and retrieves three pendants after rescuing Zelda. This is to get the Master Sword. Upon doing so, and after giving the Pendants up to retrieve the Sword, Zelda is kidnaped.2. N64: Link, after receiving a mission from the Deku Tree, goes and wins the three Spiritual Stones. Upon doing so, he goes to Hyrule City, but not before learning Zelda is kidnaped. He places the three Spiritual Stones in their place, and the Door of Time is opened, and there the sword is. Retrieving the Sword, goes to the Temple of Sages, or whatever it is called. Is given first Sage Medallion.3. SNES: After winning the three pendents, Link must now go between two versions of the world (Light World/Dark World). Link must go back and forth between the two worlds to beat the game.4. N64: In this great stunning adventure, Link must go between two versions of his world. One is when he is young, the other when he is an adult. This is achieved by putting the sword back in its pedestal. Just like in SNES LTTP, Link have to go back and forth to finish the game.When he is an adult, things are noticeable more evil, for Ganon\\'s power has grown.5. SNES: One version (Light World) is good because not corrupted by Ganon. Version II (Dark World), is an evil corrupted version of the Light World.6. N64: One version (Young Link\\'s world) is not corrupted by Ganon\\'s evil. Ganon has just recently showed up. Version II (Adult Link\\'s world), is an evil corrupted version (albeit older) of Young Link\\'s world. The only difference is in one its two different versions of the same thing, in Zelda 64 it\\'s the time barrier. But for game play, they\\'re the same.7. SNES: He, Link, must recover seven crystals hidden in seven dungeons (sounds logical). With the maidens\\' power, they will open to door to Ganon\\'s castle.8. N64: Link has to recover five medallions to open Ganon\\'s Tower.9. SNES: The (massive) closer dungeon is a tower.10. N64: The (weak) closer dungeon is a tower.11. SNES: After beating Ganon, you save Zelda, who had been kidnaped. Although one could argue you save her in Turtle Rock, she is still imprisoned in the Crystal with the other maidens, each in their respective Crystals.12. N64: Sticking to the standard Nintendo story, after recovering the medallions and beating Ganon, guess what, Link saves Zelda. There\\'s a shocker.13. SNES: There are various mini-games, heart pieces, and extra things to do. This trend is continued in Link\\'s Awakening also.14. Zelda 64: Stuck with the trend of mini-games, four heart pieces to make a heart, and extra things to do.15. SNES: In some of the houses, you can find a picture of Mario on the wall.16. N64: In Zelda 64, after meeting Zelda, look out the window, and you can find some pictures of Mario, Luigi, Bowser, and the Princess. Yoshi also comes up. Malon and Talon wear Bowser amulets also. Just goes to show, Nintendo likes cameos.As you can see for yourself, the various structural symmetries between Zelda 64 and SNES Zelda is quit a few. If Miyamoto wanted to do a remake of LTTP for N64 that\\'s what he should have done, I suppose. This, as far as story goes, is pretty much an update with little changed. Its like they took the game\\'s basic plot, changed the circumstances and added where appropriate, but allowing the basic structure to stand. And, although both are great games, sadly, SNES is better, consistently with each dungeon getting a little harder and more complex. But I love Ocarina of Time all the same. This just helps support my believe that Nintendo is first and foremost a gaming company, not a writing company.*In all previous Zelda games, the end dungeon was in the mountains. This is the first game in the series to break that trend. The first three (Zelda I, II, and LTTP) their dungeon was in Death Mountain. Link\\'s Awakening, Link\\'s only Game Boy adventure (currently) is in Tal Tal Mountains. At least we have something that broke one of the several trends running thru this classic series.',\n",
       " \"This is one of the best games I have ever played.  I love the gameplay.  It was easy to control the character.  I also enjoyed how it wasn't a very easy game.  When a game is challenging, I play it more and more.  In fact, I still play this game today.  Very good game.\",\n",
       " 'This is the 2nd best Nintendo 64 game to date right behind Golden Eye 64. We all know that Golden Eye 64 is impossible to top, but this comes damn near close.Zelda Ocarina of Time is a classic. Five stars plus. Matter of fact this is the best Zelda release I have ever played. And I have played them all.The graphics really show what the Nintendo 64 is capable of putting out along with other classics like Mario 64 and Golden Eye. The graphics are amazing and are top notch.The storyline is even better. Most good RPGs have more than just one single character. This game however only has Link and still manages to become a classic like most of the other Zelda titles. No this game is no Final Fantasy IIV, but in a way this game is better. Maybe not as long, but the storyline is a little bit more creative and catchy.Ocarina of Time offers a little bit more &quot;extras&quot; than the previous Zelda titles have to offer. You can collect extra items along the way for personal score to see how good your discovering ability is, and not just finding pieces of hearts. There are so many secrets with this game.I would suggest you dont use the strategy guide until you have completed the game. If you do, then you are cheating yourself and making the game not even worth playing. Beat the game and then look at the guide to see what you have missed.Overall, I spent a lot of time on this game. I could have beaten it a lot faster, but that wouldnt be any fun, because the fun part is discovering the secrets within the game itself.Buy the game and see for yourself. This isnt exactly a hard challenge of a game, but it isnt exactly that simple either. Just right. Get it today!',\n",
       " \"(Note:This is the Gamecube Collectors Edition version)I remember ten years ago,seeing the commercial for this game.I always did wonder what it was like.After getting the collectors edition I immediately got started on it.The story focuses,as always,on Link.Link is a young boy living in the Kokiri Forest.One night he has a nightmare,and wakes to discover a fairy named Navi,who will help him through his journey.He is overjoyed but then discovers that the gaurdian of Kokiri Forest,the Great Deku Tree,is dying from a curse.The tree passes along a Spiritual Stone and recommends to see Princess Zelda.Link does so and Zelda tells him to get the other two spiritual stones so Link can get the Master Sword to stop Ganon,King of the Gerudos,from entering the Sacred Realm and stealing the Trifoce,a divine relic.Link achieves the other stones and the Ocarina of Time.Link draws the Sword and finds out he has been tricked by Ganon,who entered the Sacred Realm.Link awakens seven years later,and after discovering he is now an adult,meets Rauru the Sage of Light.According to Rauru,the only way to defeat Ganon is to awaken the Five Sages.That is where the true quest begins.Wow,what a story!Now,the graphics are not bad by today's standards.Neither are the dungeons.They are amazing.And also very complicated.(Please don't mention the Water Temple).Overall this game can be summed up by one word:Perfect.Buy the game,become the hero,and have the time of your life.\",\n",
       " 'Ocarina of Time is a massive, epic Action/Adventure game out for the N64.  Many have been tempted to call it the best game ever (just read some other reviews) but I would step back from that.  It is still one of my favorite games, despite the fact that I play mostly RPG\\'s.  By the way, Zelda is not an RPG, even though you do talk to people and have a sword.In Zelda you play as Link (Zelda is the princess, not the main character) as you go on a quest to save the world from the evil Ganondorf by freeing each of six spirits from their different temples.  You change between times, where you are adult or child Link, and you have to switch often, and do different things in both, and each time has different weapons and items.  The time-traveling aspect of the game is one of the coolest parts.The real-time combat is a lot of fun, and fairly well put together.  It involves a \\'Z-targeting\\' system in which you can select a monster and then keep it in the center of the screen and move around it.  The fights against other monsters with swords and shields are great as a result.  Z-targeting is not perfect, but it works well.The dungeons are all awesome, and very unique.  Each dungeon is mostly based around one particular item or weapon, its own gimmick, but despite that they really don\\'t seem forced, and stay fresh all the way through (although, the last couple dungeons aren\\'t nearly as long as the others, almost like the designers started getting bored).  For the most part the dungeons aren\\'t too difficult if you know what to do, but it is very easy to get stuck if you don\\'t, and the game often leaves you on your own to figure out what to do, especially on side quests, so having a good walkthrough nearby is helpful.The overall story isn\\'t too great (for the most part, \"save the princess\"), but many of the individual events and side stories are neat.  The characters and different races which populate the world are cool, especially the Gorons, which are one of the best races ever.  The bosses of each dungeon are awesome, as well as being original, and can usually be beaten by hacking them up, or through the use of special tactics.  It\\'s always good to have a choice.Despite how good it is, Zelda isn\\'t perfect.  The graphics, for example, are nice, but they are old, and on the N64.  The music is okay, but mostly just ambient, and the classic Zelda overworld theme is conspicuously missing.  Having to constantly change which items you have equipped is also annoying, even if there isn\\'t really a better system available.  Some would say Zelda has an almost kiddy atmosphere and suffers from an occasional lack of seriousness (I would tend to disagree).  And of course, the fairy is annoying, but no reason to like the game any less.All in all, Zelda is a great game, and a must buy for any N64 owner, as it is one of the best Action/Adventure games ever.  If you are looking for an RPG, look elsewhere.  This isn\\'t one.  And be prepared to get a little frustrated.  Zelda is pretty long, especially if you do everything there is to do.  Maybe 25-30 hours if you run straight through, but  it could take many more depending on how much extra stuff you do, or how often you get stuck.  Have fun.',\n",
       " \"I first started playing Ocarina of Time from a good friend of mine. The graphics are really cool and it shows realistic images of stories. I don't see why anybody would give this game only 1 star. I sure enjoyed the good pictures of this game. Next time I'm in a video game store. I am going to buy this game. First of all, the adventure begins when this little boy is at home sleeping. A fairy comes to him and wakes him up. Then you have to find this sword and find the Great Deku Tree. I never get tired of this game because you travel to different places accomplishing many tasks! There are many items you can use too!I think The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is even better than most playstation and playstation 2 games! It is just that good to me.If you ever see this game in a store, buy it. You will have a good time with this game!\",\n",
       " 'This is truely the best game for 64 becuase link is so cool. This is probabaly the best zelda game. Ganondorf is the man and you beat him in this game. If you havent played this game, i dont know but anyways in this one you could be big link and little link. Not like in majoros mask where you could only be little link. This game is way better than majoros mask. If you still have 64 (get a gamecube, so you can play windwaker)you need to get this great game.',\n",
       " 'This has been deemed the best-made game of all-time, and even though it\\'s going on 15 years since its release, I can\\'t disagree.People complain that this game has no replay value, is too easy, and the graphics aren\\'t good.Well, I\\'ve revisited this game several times since it came out in 1998, and I haven\\'t found a lack of replay value; there\\'s so many sub-missions, I don\\'t see how you can\\'t think of this game as novel and new every time you replay it.This game has a perfect balance of gameplay for first-time gamers and extra sub-missions for experienced ones. Think it\\'s too easy? Obviously you haven\\'t gotten all the heart pieces, found all the Skulltulas, earned all the jars, achieved the Biggoron sword, or caught the Hylian Loach. Any one of those tasks would create a challenge for anyone.Complaining about the graphics? Sorry, the game isn\\'t on XBOX or Playstation format. In 1998, this game had state-of-the-art graphics. As I am in the process of beating this game for a third time in 2011, I still don\\'t find the graphics something to complain about.This game excels in both gameplay and storyline. I find it hard to believe that anyone who has played at least half this game would say they \"hate\" such a masterpiece.',\n",

       " 'This game is truly phenonemonal. From the amazing graphics (for what it is; a N64 game), to the music, to the challenging gameplay, to the engulfing storyline, the \"Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time\" is a must-play for any age. You start the game off as young Link (or whatever you want to call him), who lives in an enchanted forest where young never grow old. Inside the forest, there is a godly tree, who could be considered to be infinitly wise. The tree senses Link has the power to overthrow a great evil which is arising, and tests him to the dungeon inside of him. Link comes out, sucessful, and the tree tells him the story of the great evil which is arising. From then on, you play young Link, and must overcome many obstacles. As a child, there are 3 dungeons, and the tree\\'s counts as one, so you\\'re making some time, right? WRONG. There\\'s much more to this game then beating dungeons. As a child, you can\\'t acess as many of the things, but after you advance 7 years to the future and attain the Master Sword, many of these things are then open to you. As a child, you got an ocarina, in which you must learn songs on to access special places or do special things. Now, you can do all those things, and more. My personal favorite is Epona\\'s song, in which you place a horse\\'s (Epona) song, and it comes to you, in which you can ride across Hyrule Field to get to places twice as fast. As a child, you have weapons like a stick (whoopey), a sword, a shield, a sling-shot, and Duku Nuts. As an adult, you can handle 2 swords: the Master Sword, and the Giant Sword, which is so big you must handle it with 2 hands, which means no shield. You also have the hook-shot, Megaton Hammer, bow-and-arrows, and magic crystals you can do different things with. I cannot begin to explain how amazing this game is. I\\'d buy a Nintendo 64 all over again just for this. Now I have a Playstation 2, and I still have my Nintendo 64, but only play two games on it; this, of course, and Super Smash Brothers. Now, do yourself a favor, buy this game, and experience teh magic yourself.',\n",

Third, the gameplay and controls are easy to master, so you probably wont be swinging your sword at an enemy when you intended to throw bombs at it like games with complicated buttons. (; Fourth, the thing that makes Zelda, well, Zelda! The dungeons. The puzzles in them are chalenging and fun. The scenery in the dungeons (and everything else) is amazing.

       " \"I'll keep this short, as most people have probably already played this, but when this game released in 1996 there was literally NOTHING like it. no fully 3d adventure with the calibur of Ocarina of Time existed in those days. the sheer quality of this game was unheardof in 1996. the graphics were smiply beautiful for their time, and the gameplay was near perfection.You start the game as a young Kokiri boy living in the forest village with your friends and the old, wise Tree of Life. when darkness strikes your small corner of the world its up to you to delve into the tree and find out whats truly hurting and potentially killing him. after solving the situation in your home a much broader world of discovery and adventure opens up to you, and its up to you to save Hyrule.after completing 3 childhood dungeons and playing the song of time in the temple of time, you find yourself frozen in a time warp for 7 years, waking up at age 18 (i believe) waking up in adulthood you make your way across 5 more dungeons before conquering the final fortress, and facing one desperate final stand from the evil thats been behind all the trouble from the start.Truly epic in every way, considering the year it was released. Ocarina of Time is still the greatest game ever created in my opinion.10/10\",\n",
       " 'Since Amazon is sort of combining Ocarina of Time and Majora\\'s Mask into one review, I will write a review for both games. Both games have been remade for the GameCube, and I own both the original N64 version and the GameCube version. The gameCube versions were released if you bought a GameCube at a certain time and if you pre-ordered the Wind Waker.THE LEGEND OF ZELDA: OCARINA OF TIMEThis game started out as you as the \"Hero of Time\". You were the only forest child without a fairy, and the Great Deku Tree sent the annoying little fairy to you. When you go to the Deku Tree, he says you must get these Spiritual Stones to open the Door of Time, and a bunch of other crap like that.Sound and Music: 9.5/10.0 This game has one of the best scores in the video game world, and the ocarina songs are very good. 100% credit to the music makers of all the Zelda Games, these are some great songs. The only problem is you can\\'t shut it off. Sometimes it gets annoying, and it doesn\\'t help if you are stuck on a level for hours.Graphics: 2004: 4.0/10.0 1998: 9.0/10.0 In this day in age the graphics are so good these look like horrible. If this game was released today, everyone would laugh. Back in 1998, these graphics were the best out there. But the good thing about them is you can see the faces unlike some of those games fromt hat time it made you go blind.Difficulty: 10.0/10.0 This game is HARD! I beat it barely without a strategy guide, and you can be stuck on levels like the Forest Temple and the freaking Water Temple for MONTHS. If you beat the game with a strategy guide, you take the challenge and fun out of it. You also won\\'t have many broken items, like controllers or TV\\'s.Gameplay: 1,000,000.0/ 10.0 It is considered the best game ever, and was the 1998 Game Of The Year. You could do EVERYTHING in this game, and it is very fun doing all those side quests and other crap. This game is like no other. No other game can match this, none of that Final Fantasy or any other RPG match it, it is the best Nintendo game ever made.THE LEGEND OF ZELDA: MAJORA\\'S MASKThe game takes a huge turn in Majoras Mask as young Link goes out with Epona from Hyrule. No Ganondorf\\'s in this game, because it revolves around Majora\\'s Mask, a mask stolen by this little imp from the Happy Mask Shop guy from OOT. You have three days to get the mask back, but you must keep going back using the Ocarina and the Song of Time.Sound and Music: 9.5/ 10.0 It is like a carbon copy of Ocarina of Time, and the suspensful music is very catchy. The game has great music, ALL ZELDA GAMES HAVE GREAT MUSIC.Graphics: Same As Ocarina of TimeDifficulty: 9.5/10.0 Not as bad as Ocarina of Time, but that doesn\\'t mean it is not frustrating and challenging. You can\\'t be scared away by the challenge of these games because they are just too great.Gameplay: 10.0/10.0 The whole mask collecting concept is very fun and it a change from beating Ganondorf like in all the other games. You will feel deja vu of Ocarina of Time because the characters are the same, just different. The game is fun and a great challenge. Overall, these games are classical N64 greats!',\n",
       " 'Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time is a classic.  It should be played by every Nintendo fan and fans who are not big on Nintendo.  The Zelda series is infact a big popular series but this one defys all of them.  Ocarina of Time is a stand alone Zelda classic.  It is not only the best Zelda game but it is possibly the greatest game ever created on a console.  The story line is oh so brilliant and the graphics(even for todays standard) are unbelievable.  Anyone who owns a Nintendo 64 needs this game.  This game is pretty old and pretty cheap(I lost my game so I baught one for 5 bucks at Gamestop)so it won\\'t be hard to find.  This game infact shows what the Nintendo 64 is capable of.  The game is very well made as you play through a huge world...well not that huge..  And I will say this..(I may be exagerating this though) But the Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time has one of the best \"boss battle finale\" ending ever..Ubelievable..Graphics in this game a superb.  There were parts in the game were I would just stand there and stare at the ocean, houses anything cause it looked so beautiful.  I loved how they created the bosses especially the last one and it was amazing how realistic they made the horse look.  Nintendo scores big with the graphics.  The gameplay is magneficent.  I loved how it was all made and done.  I really can\\'t get into this one, you\\'ll just have to play this part for yourself....The sound is..My god...It\\'s beautiful I even downloaded all the songs.  I loved the song were your in the temple and you get the Mastersword cause they made that song really well.  The music in the farm were Epona is was made extreamly well and was just BRILLIANT!  As I\\'ve stated the story in this game is just plain good, though it obviously has the \"save\" themed plot as you all know and I won\\'t really get into the plot since there is already like 500 reviews saying what the plot is about..Sure the game is old and outdated, I guess..But so what..The game is still one of the greatest games of all time.  I\\'ll put it in simple words for you, the game is flawless!  The game has an amazing plot that will suck you in, the gameplay is fun and classic(as well as riding Epona the horse)and music is just plain beautiful, the enviroments and atmosphere of the game as just as incredible as the game itself is and as I stated before...Ocarina of Time is simply the greatest video game ever made(and if it\\'s not possible then it has hands down the best video game ever made, no the best video game OF ALL TIME)....Get this game you will not regret it!5 out of 5!!!!(if I could I would give it 100000 out of 5)',\n",
       " \"This and Super Mario 64 are the best games for this console. Now this was the first Zelda game I ever played, and it's gold cartridge. Now, this is a zelda game that's good to bring in the newcomer (or Link to the Past). This game is not too difficult, but difficult enough. The story is one of the best stories I've seen in a video game, very original. The one thing about this game I don't like are the water dungeons. It's a trend in Zelda games to make the levels that involve water the hardest part in the game, but it is passable.In conclusion, good game for newcomer and the best storyline to keep you hooked on the series!\",\n",
       " \"In this, one of two installments in the Zelda series for the Nintendo 64, you once again take on the persona of young Link (or whatever you choose to name him), as he embarks on a quest to save the land of Hyrule from the dark forces of Ganon.  One of the great conflicts in Nintendo history, second only to that of Mario and Bowser.  You start the quest as a boy and end up as a man.  Along the way, you will fight many monsters, explore dungeons and temples, rescue a horse (great for traveling through the world of Hyrule quickly), engage in numerous side quests and mini-games, learn many different tunes for your Ocarina, pick up a number of weapons and other helpful items, meet some gorgeous fairies, and in short, have a wonderful gaming experience.As with the other Zelda games, this one is filled with different puzzles of various types, most of which you MUST complete in order to advance in the game.  They are engaging, but not too difficult to figure out, for the most part.  There are a few, though, that I had a tough time with.  Not to fear, though, there is plenty of help out there, both in books and on the internet, to aid you through those difficult spots.  The controls are wonderfully intuitive.  Navigating through Hyrule is much like controlling Mario in Super Mario 64 (and the game does, at times, suffer from awkward camera angles like Mario did), and there are good tutorials in the game itself that teach you the ins and outs of fighting monsters and defending yourself.The Z-targeting system is excellent, once you get used to it.  You don't really need it for some of the early monsters, but by the time you become an adult, it will be essential.  In addition, you have a little fairy buddy, Navi, who continually travels with you and is always willing to give you helpful advice on what to do next after you complete a given task.  Navi will also help you with advice on the weak spots of the many different monsters you will encounter throughout the game.As I mentioned before, there are a number of side quests throughout the game.  They're not essential to finish the game, but they are a lot of fun, and some of them will get you prizes that will make the later stages of the game a little easier.  One word of advice - when you reach Lake Hylia, be sure and talk to the two scarecrows!  Later in the game, you will be glad you did.  Also, be wary of purchasing too many items in the various shops and bazaars.  They have many useful items, but they are also VERY expensive, and almost everything in there can be found for free in various nooks and crannies in the game.  Also, be wary of Gorons who want to sell you a Giant Sword.  Don't say I didn't warn you...Although you do not NEED a Rumble Pak to play the game, your gaming experience will be enhanced if you get one.  The Pak will be set off whenever Link gets near a secret area, which are sprinkled liberally throughout Hyrule.  These secret areas contain goodies that you really don't want to miss out on.All in all, an excellent game which showcases the abilities of the N64 to great effect.  Games like this are why I will always remain a Nintendo fan.  But, don't take my word for it - pick it up!  You'll be glad you did.\",\n",

       " 'Zelda OCT is an action-adventure RPG (there is debate about this, and some argue Zelda is it\\'s own genre) with a combination of puzzles, fighting, and racing. Anyone who enjoys this genre will be enthralled by OCT (which you can play on several Nintendo platforms including the 64 and Gamecube). I still play Zelda OCT 10+ years later on the Gamecube from time to time, it\\'s that good of a game.Graphics:For the time period, Zelda OCT on the 64 was beautiful and it has stood the test of time FAR better than other older games on consoles. It was the first truly 3D game for a console and set the standard for what video games should look like. If you grew up on newer systems and PC\\'s, these graphics will look \"blocky\" to you, but the Gamecube has an OCT version with more refined graphics. Still, if you want a \"retro\" video game experience, the N64 Zelda OCT has graphics that are still enjoyable today.Story:The Zelda story is perfect for a video game, as the basic premise is always the same. Link, a young boy (or young man in newer games), is the reincarnated hero of time. He must battle the evil Ganon/Ganondorf to save Hyrule and princess Zelda by using the power of the Triforce.Zelda OCT molds the \"Zelda Story\" into a fantastic tale that will take a least a few months to beat for your first time. The game\\'s puzzles become progressively more difficult, culminating in the notoriously challenging dungeon - the Water Temple. The story combines several races (Hylians, Kokiri, Gerudo, Gorons, and Zora) seamlessly into one large kingdom. The enemies are varied and interesting as well. The Fantasy-Adventure story line is complex and intricate, complete with twists and shocks, time-travel, and genocide. Time affects the characters, and you see that not everyone loses when evil prevails. The story details are amazingly deep, to the point that pictures on someone\\'s wall and the clothes they wear can fill in some back story of that character. I loved the detail and enjoyed filling in little pieces of the \"back story\" by talking to the NPCs and looking through the first person scope at their tattoos and clothes. The main story is also amazing, with the typical epic sword-clashing adventure ingeniously employed in the Zelda OCT universe. It\\'s truly a master\\'s greatest work.Game Play:The 64 had a simple controller for fun game play. There are only a few buttons, A, B, Z, C-pad, R1, L1, joystick, and the D-pad. The D-pad isn\\'t needed in Zelda 64. This limited key selection was used to build an elegant fighting system around a few button combinations. Although B always attacks and A always does \"an action\", the genius of this system falls in the types of attacks you can do. Depending on the way your character is moving, and whether or not an item is targeted, Link can perform an impressive list of sword attacks (vertical cut, horizontal slash, diagonal slash, spin attack, thrust, and jump attacks). Despite the fact that B, Z, and the joystick are the only buttons that control these moves, Link is easy to control and I never had problems getting Link to perform the combination of moves I desired. Link could cut any sign into 5 unique pieces consistently - that is excellent controller response!In addition to the perfect synchronization of Link to the game controls (something newer games like Dark Souls could take a lesson on) the game play is interesting and varied. Although the main fighting style will be slashing it up with your sword, each monster has a unique weakness that you can take advantage of with a variety of weapons. Link not only totes a one-handed sword and shield, but he also get\\'s access to a sling shot and deku seeds, boomerang, hook shot, bow and arrows, bombs, deku sticks, deku nuts, and two impressive two-handed weapons: a hammer and a sword. These weapons can all be used in different ways to different effects at various times in the games.Although the game would have been interesting enough with just those weapons, the game is further varied by magic. Link can wield three types of hand magic, as well as three types of magic arrows. This adds another level of monster fighting, where Link tries to find the weakness so he can move in and dice them up.Apart from the impressive array of weapons, Link also packs a varied wardrobe. The stoic hero is far from interested in fashion (I mean, he runs around in a tunic and tights with a long cap, so he obviously doesn\\'t care about his looks), so each piece has a specific use. You can mix and match boots and tunics for different benefits. Some bosses can only be beat with the right combination of clothing and shields, and figuring out how to use which items against a difficult boss is part of what makes Zelda OCT a great game.Wait, there\\'s still more to combat. Apart from the variety of moves and effects Link can muster with his impressive array of items, there is also horseback combat. You can ride around on Epona, a fierce, wild, mare who only listens to you, and shoot things with your bow and arrow. There are also mini games centered around the fun and challenging horseback combat.Summary:Zelda OCT is an excellent Action-Adventure RPG with an epic story line that seamlessly melds a complex kingdom and elegant fighting style into a grand video game. The characters are interesting, with even the most minor sentinels having a back story that you can uncover. The main story is fun to progress through, and you care about a lot of the characters you meet. The controls are excellent and perfectly integrated for fun, non-frustrating, game play. The bosses are challenging, requiring wit to uncover their weakness from the surroundings and circumstances before you can move in and damage them with your sword.Final Note:If the 64 is too retro for you, Zelda OCT has been remade for the Gamecube with newer graphics. However, the Gamecube controller does not integrate as seamlessly as the 64 (understandably) so you will miss out on a large part of what made Zelda 64 great. Additionally, there is a 3DS version, but I haven\\'t played that so I really can\\'t comment.',\n",
       " \"This is the best game I have ever played.It has very good music,grapics,and the story is great!I really love this game,but the only really big problem with this game is that it has this one(long and boring)temple that is very hard,and(please)don't take this game lightly,the bosses are hard,but the story is so good that you will want to play this game again and again!But the other Zelda games are lame!So only (if you want to)buy this game and maybe 'the legend Zelda A link to the past'.  PROS:the story is great,It's a fun game,and the great fairys(Fairys that will power you up and give you new weapons) are easy to find.  CONS:switching around the camera is a little bit hard,and finding the goldskull tokens(gold coin like tokens that you win from beating spider monsters)is easy at the beginning of the game but hard at the end.

At some points, you are required to move into the future 7 years, where Link is a full-grown adult, and sometimes back 7 years to advance in your journey. As an adult, some things will have changed. And when day turns to night and vice versa, some things will change that will be different when compared to the same place, only in the daytime.The battles are intense. And as for the boss battles, the bosses have a variety of options that they can do, and to effectively defend, you usually have to be prepared for any &quot;curves&quot; that they throw at you.Legend of Zelda: OoT holds a lot of replay value. Even after I've finished the game, I'm still having a great time.Overall, Legend of Zelda: OoT is probably one of the best RPGs available. Would be definitely worth buying and would also make a wonderful gift!\",\n",

       " 'This is, to me, not only the greatest Zelda game in the series, but also the greatest game I\\'ve ever play.Where to begin? There is so much in this game that makes it so fun. I absolutely love the side quests. Getting the Biggoron Sword is a race against time, but very rewarding considering you will posess an awesome huge sword that is twice as powerful as the Master Sword!Another side quest I loved was completing the Gerudo Training Fortress to get the Ice arrows. This will force you to use all your skills and items, and will really put you to the test. I would even venture to say that the Gerudo training temple is more difficult than almost every other dungeon.The ghost hunting side quest is very tough and takes practice and patience. Capture all 10 big poes roaming the field of hyrule and sell them to the strange ghost shop. You will get the 4th bottle (the hardest to get)Even the mask salesman side quest is very interesting and unique. While many wouldn\\'t bother to complete it, but the reward is the very cool and mysterious \"Mask of Truth\". Furthermore, this side quest is slightly more significant considering that the masks are the focal point in the follow up \"Majoras\\' Mask\".But of course, my favorite side quest is the Skulltula side quest. It is very long and trying, but definitely worth it. This is another side quest many people wouldn\\'t bother to complete, but completing it does have it\\'s merits. For example: there is a very profitable rewards system in play. Destroy 10 Golden Skulltulas, and you get the adult wallet (holds 200 rupees). At 20, you get the stone of agony, which (when playing with a rumble pack inserted) will alert the player when a secret is nearby. At 30, get the Giant\\'s Wallet and you can carry 500 rupees. At 40 you get Bombchus (I know, lame). At 50, get a piece of heart. After that, you get nothing more unless you manage to destroy all 100 golden skultullas. Doing this will result in you being able to get 200 rupees every time you visit the house of skultulla. Unlimited money is very cool, although a bit useless at that late a stage in the game.The bosses are great. I won\\'t go into great detail, but I\\'ve always loved the fight with Volvagia the lava dragon. There is something so classic and satisfying about watching Link defeat a lava dragon in a volcano with the master sword and hylian shield. Also, the final battle with Gannondorf is a real treat, and I never get tired of firing the magic arrows of light at him. The fight has a very epic quality to it, and the final battle against the horribly mutated Gannon has a nightmarish ambience to it.The temples all have thier own awesome themes, both musically and environmentally. I always thought that the Forest Temple was incredibly imaginative and just stunning. It has the feel of something abandoned to the wild with overgrown vines overtaking the temple, and the open courtyard.The music is top-notch even by today\\'s standards. Koji Kondo really put together a masterpiece.There is even a sweet element of sadness in Link\\'s lost childhood, with the loss of his friendship to Saria. The moments where Shiek teaches you a song to warp to a temple always has a reference to a long lost friendship or the somewhat cruel passage of time.The ability to customize adult Link\\'s appearance is pretty unique and cool where you can choose with color tunic he wears, which sword and shield to wield.In short, this is a wonderful game that will always have a special place in my heart.',\n",

When you aren\\'t doing anything and are just playing around, you can have hours of fun running around hunting skullkids and running from those flying spikey flower thingies. When you\\'re an adult, you can hunt poes (ghosts) in the field and get rewards and stuff for it! Anyway, the story is about a boy named Link who is destined to save his home world, Hyrule, from A powerful wizard. The wizard wants to get ahold of the Triforce, an ancient artifact which has the power to alter the world. He does, and changes the world to a \"hell\".

       " \"This title might be the best game ever. The best title for the N64 it is, beyond any doubts.- Graphics: I haven't played much N64, but, for all I know, this is the best you can get in the plataform. Beautiful enviroment, landscapes, well-designed characters, different places and detailed textures for this plataform. The graphics are hot, I mean it! And you didn't even need graphics, this game would be great even without them. This game will be forever known because it has changed the world of games with such 3D graphics plus the lock-on camera, this game will be forever reminded because of that. Approved graphics.- Sound: This game has the best soundtrack ever, if you ask me... Nearly every song in this game wins a 10/10 score. I really want to find a soundtrack for this game, because both the Ocarina songs and the in-game songs are awesome. Characters don't have voices, except when they scream, when they're scared and this kind of thing, so the voice acting isn't great. But the sound wins a 9/10 because of the nearly perfect soundtrack.- Fun: This game touches you with a great story, great characters, great songs. You really feel as if you were Link in the beautiful land of Hyrule, and that makes the game so good that you can't say it's not fun. When you feel like the character, you just can't stop playing, even in the boring parts (in other words, the Water and Fire Temples). The different times you play and the many secrets hidden (I mean it, many secrets, I highly doubt you can get them all!) makes the game even greater, even more perfect.- Educative: I really don't know why this game is rated E for Everyone... I feel like the game has some scary parts (in other words, the cemitery and the Shadow Temple), so it should be rated T for Teen, even though it has no great violence, no red blood (just green blood sometimes). But you parents shouldn't worry about that. This beauty must be taken to your children.Overall, there's nothing to say. I don't know what you're doing reading my review if you haven't played this game yet. This is one of those games you must beat during your lifetime (The Wind Waker, the last game in the series, is very good, but it isn't nearly as good as Ocarina Of Time). It might take a long time for you to beat it if you're always busy, because the game is not short, but you must try. It'll be an unforgettable experience to be Link in Hyrule.\",\n",
       " 'When the Nintendo \\'64 was first introduced to the public in 1996, the game \"Super Mario \\'64\" revolutionized the gaming industry with the introduction of 3-D gaming.  However, it wasn\\'t until two years later that Nintendo really perfected the 3-D adventure genre with the release of \"The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time\".\"Ocarina\" is, for lack of a better word, a nearly perfect game in almost every sense.  The graphics are great (for N64 standards), the music is fantastic, the gameplay is smooth, and the story is incredibly engaging.  Much like the Mario franchise before it, the Zelda franchise (although already somewhat established on the NES and SNES) took a simple character (Mario to Zelda), put him in an interesting environment (Mushroom Kingdom to Hyrule), and pits him against fantastic enemies.Of course, perhaps the true greatness of \"Ocarina\" is its balance between the essential gameplay and the sidequests.  While this game added more depth (riding a horse, getting items that, while not vital to the outcome of the game, will help you, etc.) than any previous game in history, it also wasn\\'t too complicated (see \"Donkey Kong 64\").  In the game, Link has a straight-forward mission and accomplishes each objective in sequence...you only need to pursue the frivolous things if you so desire.The quirkiness of the game is also charming.  Along the way, Link meets a talking tree, gets trapped inside a fish\\'s belly, befriends the roly-poly Gorons, and liberates temples that each correspond to some sort of natural theme (forest, ice, water, fire, etc.).  The first time I ever played \"Ocarina\", and every time since, I found myself amazed by the crazy and colorful characters that Nintendo came up with for each area of the game.Finally, a great adventure games also needs to have an intriguing plot (i.e. the reason why the \"Myst\" computer game series was such a big success while its clones failed), which \"Ocarina\" delivers superbly.  Right away, you are drawn into the storyline that includes rescuing Princess Zelda, defeating the evil Gannondorf, and bring peace to Hyrule again.  I know it may sound cheesy, but without an engaging plot the game would have been little more than a sword-slashing RPG with a few puzzles thrown in.Thus, I recommend \"Ocarina of Time\" to all gamers, whether young or old, beginners or experts.  The difficulty curve is set as such that you will be able to steadily improve your skills in time to defeat each obstacle before you, while enough really challenging side quests exist that you can also hone your skills to a \"tee\" if so desired.  So whether you want to fire up the old N64, dust off the old Gamecube (for which a version of \"Ocarina\" was released), or buy the game on the Virtual Console of your Wii, do so with confidence that you will instantly be charmed by this amazing work of video game creation.',\n",
       " \"This is most likely one of the best N64 Games Ever made, Its way better then Super mario 64 in everyway (and possibly Zelda too), its rich, colorful and very addicting, The soundtracks are also one of my favorite things about the game- it has a happy and also very awesome tune to them making them addictive (you just cant stop listening to it!), and the world designs (10 total I believe) are all very Beautiful and Gorgeous, I've beaten the game to 100% and I still go back to the worlds and gaze in thier amazement, its just really cool, this game is a MUST HAVE for any Nintendo 64 player, Im serious if you dont have this, your missing out BIG time.PS. check out its Sequel Banjo-Tooie after you've bought this!\",\n",
       " 'I\\'ve had this game since way back when it was released; I just never got the chance to write a review.The Story: Banjo\\'s sister, Tooty, was \"the most beautiful girl around\" and Grunty the witch wanted her beauty, so she pulled an Amber Alert and took her to her lair. Banjo\\'s lazy bum the whole time was sleeping. It\\'s up to you to get jiggy\\'s and notes and what-not to stop Grunty and get Banjo\\'s sister back.Graphics: 9.5/10. Awesomely different and creative worlds. From a sewer, to a pirate ship on an island, to a desert and into an icy snowland, there are tons of different and unique worlds to play through. The graphics are stellar for the N64, with bright colors and cool characters with good animations. This is one of the best N64 games as far as graphics go next to games like Donkey Kong 64 and Legend Of Zelda: Majora\\'s Mask.Sound: 9/10. There aren\\'t really any voices in this game; just kind of sound effects that are different for each character. Blubber on Treasure Grove Cove sounds like he\\'s burping or throwing up, Kazooie sounds like a gagging bird, Banjo sounds like a big old hick of a bear... and so on. The music in this game, though, is some of the catchiest and the best music i\\'ve heard in really any adventure game. The music doesn\\'t really get old, and whoever created it is brilliant. Overall, the sound is really, really good.Control: 8.5/10. Being an adventure game, there are a lot of different controls for a lot of different moves. And since the N64 controller is the way it is ( pretty annoying ) it\\'s easy to get confused even after playing for hours on end, just because you go brain dead. The controls are a bit strange at first to do some of the attacks, but you will get used to them anyways.Fun: 9/10. A great game from beginning to end. Get the jiggys, move on. Get the notes, move on. That simple? No. This game is challenging and is for all ages, even if it does have a kiddy approach. The game lasts maybe 40 hours or so depending on how fast you get through the game. Great characters, great level design, and fantastic music makes this a must buy. This is one of the best games on the N64, and I.M.O., the best adventure game. Pick this game up now; it is better than its sequel and the Game Boy Advanced ones, even if all three are fantastic. Buy this game!!9.3/10',\n",
       " \"Rare just has an extraordinary knack at making great games. Banjo Kazooie was released in 1998 and has been considered a classic since, and I too must agree with this well deserved honor. Well, why do I find this game fantastic? Well, I'll explain that in my review.First off let's talk about Banjo Kazooie's story. Banjo's sister Tooty is kidnapped by the wicked witch Gruntilda. Gruntilda has planned on swapping Tooty's beauty to her, but not if Banjo and his friend Kazooie can help it! Okay, seriously this story is pretty lame, but hey! It's a game. In My opinion, no matter how good the graphics are, or how great the story is, it all boils down to one thing. And that's gameplay. And Banjo Kazooie has fantastic gameplay.In Banjo Kazooie you play as Banjo and...well...Kazooie, and Kazooie stays inside Banjo's backpack at all times, but she's not useless. They both work as a team and learn many moves, which brings us to our next character, Bottles. Bottles the mole helps you learn different moves to help you defeat Gruntilda and rescue Tooty. But do you just walk up to Gruntilda and save Tooty? Not at all, there are several items to collect to defeat Gruntilda. The most important one is jiggies, there are ten jiggies in each world and you need several items to collect them. Along the way Bottles teaches you to use certain items, such as eggs to shoot through Kazooie's mouth, or how to fly when you collect enough feathers. Another essential item to collect is mumbo tokens. Gruntilda has hidden mumbo tokens all around her enormous lair and if you collect enough you can visit the great shaman Mumbo Jumbo and he will transform you into different creatures to help you along your journey. So you have plenty to do in this game, I can guarantee that. Another essential item are music notes, in each world one hundred music notes are scattered all around and if you collect enough you can open new doors in Gruntilda's massive lair. But I do find it to become quite tedious sometimes. Why? You may ask. Because each time you leave and re-enter a world all the notes are still there, no matter how many you've collected. Let's say you've collected ninety-nine out of the hundred possible music notes to collect, well if you leave the world and re-enter, you would have to collect all ninety nine notes again, you couldn't go searching for the one music note you hadn't collected. And while yet this situation is highly unlikely, it's still annoying no matter how many notes you have to re-collect. Fortunately, if you don't care about collecting all one hundred music notes, you don't have to because the game automatically saves the amount you've collected.There aren't too many moves to learn in Banjo Kazooie, and it didn't take me long to master them. And there aren't many control problems, actually the controls are almost perfect. But I did get frustrated with a feature that was not added in the game, I wish Banjo could hang on to ledges, there was many times in Clanker's Cavern where I could almost reach a ledge,  but it was just barely out of reach because I couldn't hang on to the ledge. While yet this wasn't too big of a deal, I think that feature could of made the game a little less frustrating. I was also very pleased with camera control, there are three angles to choose from except in a few rare areas and I found it easy to maneuver.I told you this game was made in 1998, right? Well the graphics are terrific. The different atmospheres to this game make it twice more enjoyable. You can relax in broad daylight in Treasure Trove Cove, or wonder at dark in Mad Monster Mansion. And I thought the last world Click Clock Wood was absolutely brilliant, it's a forest and you collect jiggies in the four season's spring, summer, fall and winter. I especially loved Freezeezy Peak, and it was so much fun climbing the huge snowman.I also loved the music in this game, each beat is catchy and it never got repetitive for me, and the sound effects were great as well...well the only complaint I could have is that there is no dialogue in the game, but I actually found the weird sounds from the characters kind of funny and I loved the insults between Kazooie and Bottles and Gruntilda's rhymes cracked me up, that's another reason I love this game, it has such a charm to it, not like some newer games, to many games have steered away from being innocent and charming, and this game has this quality.What more can I say? This game is fun to play, it has great replay value, the music, sounds and the worlds all sound and look absolutely fantastic and the difficult final fight with Gruntilda at the end was indeed terrific as well. It took me thirty hours to complete (without a guide) and I had so much fun solving puzzles and this game can test your mind at certain times. I will admit I did need help online for a few jiggies, but the ending sequence makes the occasional frustrations all worthwhile, very satisfying if you ask me. I'm now very anxious to play Banjo Tooie, as it's been claimed to be even better than the original. Banjo Kazooie is highly recommended, this game is indeed a classic.\",\n",

       " 'Developer Rare is a master at infusing originality into their imitations. This isn\\'t a knock against them. William Shakespeare pulled stories and plots from other writers and crafted masterpieces. Rare is gamedom\\'s Shakespeare, in that regard. Banjo-Kazooie is obviously influenced by Super Mario 64, although it\\'s always unfortunate for a game to be compared to that masterpiece. While Banjo-Kazooie lacks Super Mario 64\\'s magic and ingenuity, it has its own magic that sets it apart from Nintendo\\'s behemoth.The Good:+ A fun story+ An imaginative use of its characters+ Creative worlds to exploreThe Bad:-- Too easy and short-- The few parts that are too hardThe Ugly? Why is Kazooie so insulting?Story--9/10The first thing that stands out is the dialogue, especially of the evil witch, Gruntilda, or Grunty, who speaks in clever rhymes. It\\'s refreshing all the more that what she says is often funny. The game begins with her asking her mirror, \"Who is the most beautiful of them all?\" Of course, it couldn\\'t be Gruntilda. There\\'s nothing even remotely pretty about a fat, green hag. The most beautiful of them all is Banjo\\'s younger sister, Tooty (who looks similar to Tiny Kong of Donkey Kong fame). So Grunty sets off to kidnap Tooty and succeeds, leaving only the mole, Bottles, as a witness. Bottles must survive a downpour of Kazooie\\'s insults and witticisms to explain the kidnapping to Banjo and Kazooie. The question becomes, can Banjo and Kazooie save Tooty before Grunty robs her of her beauty and transfers it to herself?Gameplay--8/10Here is the game\\'s bane and boon. Everything else sets it up wonderfully. The soundtrack is great, the visuals are very nice, and the opening story sequence is funny. The game controls smoothly and you have plenty of moves to learn and use throughout. The levels are varied, with plenty of collectibles and other goodies to discover. But these levels are so small, so short, so easy. I never spent an hour and a half on any one level, and most of them took less than an hour to complete. In that time, I could collect ten jigsaw puzzle pieces, one hundred musical notes, and numerous other items such as the Mumbo Jumbo skulls, extra lives, and Jinjos. Compared to Super Mario 64, I can\\'t help but say, is that all?There are a total of nine worlds, as well as a main hub world, which is too labyrinthine for its purpose. Rare goes a little overboard as to the amount of collectibles they expect gamers to gather. Unless you use cheats, it takes 94 out of the 100 Jigsaw pieces total to unlock every single world, including the final fight with Grunty. That\\'s not too difficult, as I\\'d say about 97 of those Jigsaw pieces are a piece of cake. More than 880 of the 900 music notes are needed in order to give you somewhat of a chance against the unfairly difficult fight with Grunty (you just can\\'t count on Rare to make a strictly children\\'s game: see Diddy Kong Racing).These are mostly criticisms, but they comprise a small percent of the game. You will spend most of it enjoyably. Despite the very easy difficulty, it isn\\'t boring. There\\'s plenty to explore in the levels, and as they go on, they become larger and more complex, especially the sprawling final level. Rare flexes all of its creative muscles in that level, revolving around the four seasons, and even includes a few semi-stories with some new characters. Not that the other levels are clunkers, but if only they could provide the same sort of entertainment, the rest of the game would have been that much more enjoyable.Longevity--5/10A game should only be as long as it needs to be, but I think Banjo-Kazooie needed to be a little longer. Considering what Nintendo did years earlier in Super Mario 64, it\\'s no excuse that Rare couldn\\'t match that level of magnitude. But it\\'s unfair to compare any game to Super Mario 64. Most gamers will complete this, all 100 Jigsaw pieces, almost all 900 music notes, in less than twelve hours. After finishing it, there\\'s no reason to go back. The cheats only give you infinite resources, but what\\'s the point when you\\'ve already finished the game? The only way a game like this can extend its life is for the single player adventure to be a little longer.',\n",
       " \"This is one game that will test your skills, on how to figure things out, but if you want to take the easy way out you can always get bottles the neer sighted mole's help.

       " 'Goldeneye 007, Killer Instint, The Donkey Kong Country series, Conker, Diddy Kong Racing....those were the good ol\\' days when Rare was still relevant.  Before they sold their souls to Microsoft and lost all credibility.  And in my opinion, the peak of Rare was with the Banjo games (kazooie & tooie) on Nintendo 64.  Kazooie, to me, defines the N64 3-D platformer.  While many will say Mario 64, which is a near perfect game.  I think the Nostalgia sometimes forgets how much BETTER Banjo Kazooie was.  Back in \\'98 rare was on a roll.  This game was yet another grandslam.  A brand new franchise, cut from scratch.  And it\\'s absolutely amazing.  I won\\'t go into all the details and story as my fellow reviewers have already made clear.  All I can add is this game is easily one of the best games of the late 90\\'s.  It was a game I picked up and loved immediately.  My only question is WHAT the **** happened to rare?!!  They were so amazing with Nintendo, then dropped bomb after bomb for the X-Box consoles.  I\\'m not a Nintendo fanboy, so don\\'t even go there.  But Rare took a big dookie all over this series with the newer games on Microsoft consoles.  The 1998 game will always be the best.  And I hope someday the brothers who originally ran Rare will comeback to bring the infamous \"Banjo Threeie\" to life on any console!!',\n",
       " \"Positive:+ gameplay is very deep with new elements added all the time+ worlds are very diverse and have a lot of content+ music tracks are great and change in style when you're in different spots+ sharp controls that work well for the most partNegative:- you have to start your note count every time you re-enter a world- camera doesn't always give you the best view you needSuper Mario 64 revolutionized the 3-D platformer; and the amount of people who would deny that are probably fewer than the words in this sentence. But when a revolution comes, what's the point of it being so revolutionary unless something comes of it later on? In video games, a game is a revolution indeed when other games take the basic model and take it to a whole new level, and possibly delivering a game that's even better than the root. Whether it really is a beneficiary of the beloved Mario 64 or Rare is just really, really good at making games, that is where we find Banjo-Kazooie.Games of the platforming genre aren't exactly known for their amazing stories, and Banjo fares no different. Banjo's little sister Tooty is kidnapped by the stereotypical green witch Gruntilda. She has some sort of weird machine that will supposedly transfer Tooty's beauty to herself, and this will leave Banjo's poor sister ugly in the process! So Banjo and his grumpy bird friend Kazooie (who for some reason lives in Banjo's backpack) set out to Gruntilda's lair to save Tooty. The story doesn't take itself very seriously at all but there's a great, humorous tone to it that more than makes up for the lack of depth.The game doesn't move from place to place at all; the whole thing takes place in Gruntilda's huge lair, key word being 'huge.' This one location is just so big but perfectly balanced with the ease of traversing that it makes the perfect setting for a platforming game. There is a whole lot of variety within the mountain lair, with a sewer, swamp, graveyard, and many other spots. The areas of different theme will almost always take you to one of the game's nine worlds, which are all big, diverse, and have a lot of stuff to find. You'll find yourself at a mountain to begin the game, then moving on to a beach, and later a snow area and haunted mansion-like world, and so on. The game never really runs out of new material to throw at you, which is really nice, even if most of the themes are found in many other games of the genre, too.Another way Banjo always keeps itself fresh is with the moves you can learn. In most of the levels you can find a mole named Bottles who will teach you a new move if you can find him. These moves are sometimes confined to certain spots or items you can put on, and they all work together perfectly to make the game progress logically. You have to unlock some of these abilities, such as flight and invincibility, to get deeper into Gruntilda's lair, and also to accomplish more in the worlds. The game controls very well too, even with all the added moves, and it doesn't get too complicated. One issue though is with the camera, which you can control the angle of but you still sometimes can't get the viewpoint that's just right for a room or area.But the core of the game stays the same, no matter how many moves you learn or different worlds you visit. The main objects to collect are jiggies, which are basically pieces of jigsaw puzzles that, when put together, open the door to a new world. Ten of these can be found in each level along with 100 notes, which open up doors to new areas of the lair. Unfortunately the game's note total is merely a combined high score of how many notes you collect in each level; each time you re-enter a world the note count restarts. This is pretty annoying sometimes, and it would have been nice to just keep all the notes so you don't have to recollect all of them again to advance your total note count. Thankfully the jiggies are extremely well-balanced as far as how hard they are to get; in the first world most of them are sitting on the ground like Easter eggs, but as you progress through the game you have to work much harder to earn your way to more worlds.Graphically Banjo kept up to date well enough. The visuals are just a tad choppy, but they still look good enough, and that sort of thing happened all the time in the N64 era. Sometimes objects that are a little ways away won't appear on screen until you get closer, which thankfully doesn't prove to be too annoying but still would be good if fixed. Despite these few flaws, though, the graphics look great considering the times.One of Banjo's shining areas aside from gameplay is the sound. The characters speak in a gibberish sort of language (with text shown on the bottom of the screen) and this might annoy some but it's still good to add personality to each character. The sound effects are all good too, no complaints there. The really cool part of the sound, though, is the music. The tracks are cool enough as they are, but when you're standing on a different spot or in a different area, like if you're under water or at the entrance to a different world, the music style and sound totally changes while keeping the same song. Then as you exit the spot the music transitions back to the normal style, and this effect may sound small without actually hearing it but trust me when I say it's really, really cool.Mario 64 may have been the revolution, but some of the games that derived bits and pieces from it were possibly even better, in my opinion. Banjo-Kazooie is one such game, adding a lot of depth and value to an already proven formula. It may not be the game everyone looked to for inspiration in the game-making world, but Banjo-Kazooie is a real gem from Rare's glory days on the N64, and it makes me want to play the sequel even if it is ten years old.Gameplay: 9.5Graphics: 8.5Sound: 9.5Camera & Control: 8.5Value: 9.5FINAL SCORE: 9.2/10\",\n",
       " \"Banjo Kazooie is a game I've played many times since I got it in the early 2000s and while its fun, its not the most entertaining game I've played. There's two main objectives in Banjo Kazooie: hunting and gathering. You hunt for these jigsaw pieces called Jiggys to help you complete jigsaw puzzles to open worlds. You gather all sorts of items within each level like musical notes, Jinjos, Mumbo tokens, feathers, etc. This concept gets boring after awhile but nevertheless the game is pretty fun as a whole. I'd recommend the sequel, Banjo Tooie, instead as its 10 times more entertaining.\",\n",
       " \"All in all, this is the best platform game that I have played in a long time. Of course, it follows the basic formula of a platformer - kidnapped female, evil castle, jump on enemies, etc. But the reason the formula still exists is due to the fact that, occasionally, it works really well. Banjo-Kazooie is a case where the cliche works to perfection. Although we question Nintendo's blatant violation of the genetic cloning ban put in place by the president, they did so for a good cause, and a damn good game.\",\n",

       " \"This game is fantastic. Personally, I love it. Have you ever played a game where an evil witch is ugly and wants to be evil so she steals a beautiful girl named Tooty to try and transfer the beauty to the ugly witch? Also, have you ever played a game where a bear and bird have to collect golden puzzle pieces, musical notes, dinosaurs mixed with teddy bears named Jinjos? Also, have you ever played a game where a shaman transforms the bear and bird into various forms? Well, if you haven't, this is where to start. This game is perfect for all ages. I would recommend this game to anyone who has a N64.\",\n",
       " 'I\\'ve never really had enough of an attention span to play \"collect the item\" games, but this particular one is really great. It has enough action and puzzle involved to hold the attention of even a gamer like me (with, honestly and unfortunately, a terribly short attention span) for hours at a time, with enough elements of finding things you\\'ll need later to keep you playing and replaying each level. A truly great game, and I wish more of the sort were made these days. I feel way too young to be saying this, but they just don\\'t make them like this anymore!On a side note, the cartridge I received has some... Interesting connections. I\\'d guess the previous owner loved and played it as much as I do haha.',\n",
       " \"This is one of the best games out there, it's a classic. Banjo-Kazooie is one of the rarest and hard to find games ever, The story is really good. A witch kidnaps a beautiful girl and wants to be the prettiest of them all. Her brother and his pal Kazooie have to save her. While its a relatively easy it can still be hard in some places and there are cheat codes to help you along the way with things like Gold feathers, Red feathers and Eggs. However if you quit and save your game then the cheat has to be reentered. While the game does have it's flaws its still really fun to play. The game essentially is very easy next to its sequel game, Banjo Tooie. The levels all relatively easy, however it is very easy to die in this game, on top of that like other reviewers on Amazon have said about dying and losing notes and recollecting them is toldly true. Clarkers Cavern was the worst because you only have 6 things of air and have to get extra air, from a fish blowing bubbles. The level that is the most challenging of them all was Click Clock Wood. Because of going from the changing seasons and having to grab notes from all seasons that was tough for me. However the most challenging and difficult part of this game, is beating Grunty herself. That is the most challenging part of this game. because you have to hit her with eggs and unfortunately its a huge flaw on Rare's part for not putting a homing shooter like they do in the sequel game. Overall despite it's many flaws Nintendo and Rare have done an excellent job making a game that is graphically pleasing, and the gameplay is awesome. Buy it you won't regret it.\",\n",
       " \"This is one of my all time favorite games. The characters are likeable, with hilarious dialogue and an intriguing story. Also the music is some of the best I've ever heard in a video game.

If only Microsoft hadn't ruined Rare...\",\n",
       " \"Now that Banjo & Kazooie is over five years old a sequel now exist and there is likely another game coming. HOPEFULLY! The game only for the N64 is one of the most amazing platformers ever. In fact it's one of the most amazing games in any genre period. It took a while to beat the game, but it was well worth it. If your not familiar with B & K, let me explain.. Banjo is a bear with a handy backpack. Kazooie is a bird who hangs out in Banjo's backpack. With the many special moves Kazooie pops out of the pack quite a bit. Together they work through many HUGE levels collecting items like puzzle pieces (100 hidden through out the entire game), musical notes (100 on each level), little Jinjo people (5 on each level), there are also Mumbo skulls to find, they allow you (once you have the required amount) to change form, you must visit the mumbo skull guy quite often. Changing form is mandatory, for instance B & K cannot fit into some smaller places. Turning into an ant allows you to go into a small hole where prizes are not reachable otherwise. Vast and adventurous, B & K is impossible to dislike even if your not a fan of platformers. Even if your just watching, it's entertaining. I'll give you an idea of how effective the story is. BANJO & KAZOOIE is THE WIZARD OF OZ of vidoe games.\",\n",
       " \"I have never played anything like this since. Everything from Sly  Racoon, to Ratchet and Clank, owe it to this.Wicked witch Gruntilda takes Banjo's sister to hey layer, miles away in a realistic 3D cartoon world.Banjo is a bear with Kazooie a bird in his backpack that can help him jump and fly and basically you learn to do lots of things with it. You solve puzzles via action and collect tolkens across lovely maps. Mumbo Jumbo transforms Banjo into some other creatures along the way. You can fly. It was amazing. A full adventure all the way to end. We played it for months and I have NEVER played anything like it again. The makers of Donkey Kong released it at the best time. It is now up to the future generations to make adventure concepts better than this one. This is one of the best N64 games ever.\",\n",
       " 'There is not much I can say except this is THE BEST GAME FOR N64. Not too easy, not too hard, tons of levels and objectives and the cutest cast of characters (Jinjos rock) If you like adventure games, Banjo-Kazooie is for you!',\n",
       " \"Banjo-Kazooie is an action adventure game in the style of Super Mario 64. However, it is similar, yet also quite different. Rather than having most of the skills you need at the beginning of the game, you learn a few in the very beginning, and then learn the remaining skills throughout the first six worlds (there are nine, but they are much larger than the fifteen in Mario 64). Notes are like coins, and jiggies are like stars. However, rather than six stars in each world, there are 10 jiggies to find in each world, and 10 in the witch's castle (much like the castle secret stars). Also, you can transform in five of the nine massive levels with the help of the crazy witch doctor Mumbo-Jumbo. Generally, it will help you get at least 1 Jiggy in the world, and they can do things that Banjo and Kazooie can't on their own. Throughout the game, you get to transform into a termite (level 1), an alligator (level 4), a walrus (level 5), a pumpkin (level 7), and a bee (level 9).The nine massive worlds are each very different from eachother. But how fun are they? Well, they're all very fun to play in, mainly because the tunes in each world really match the mood, from eerie funeral dirges to peppy shipyard music, this game has that and then some. Overall, I highly recommend it. If you read my previous review of the game Banjo-Tooie, you'd see why I enjoyed the sound effects so much. Once more, I highly recommend this game.\",\n",

       " \"After Rareware turned GoldenEye into a system-seller for the Nintendo 64, it broke out again with the action-platformer Banjo-Kazooie. An ugly old witch named Gruntilda has taken Banjo's sister Tootie and plans to suck the beauty out of her. Banjo and Kazooie (the bird that lives in his backpack) must brave Gruntilda's fortress to get Tootie back.The plot is a little sugary and kiddie, but it's really just an excuse to send gamers on a Mario 64-style adventure, where completing tasks and puzzles in worlds will open up new worlds to explore. Yes it's pretty much a clone of Mario, but at the same time it refines and enhances the Mario formula. Players have more unique special moves at their disposal, and these are much more essential to navigating the environment and solving puzzles. Worlds are beautiful, creative, and expansive, tossing you into a room with a giant shark, a huge snowman, or a forest where you can actively move between the seasons. It's all topped by memorable music that changes to fit the environment, fades, or grows louder depending on where you are in the stage.This is a game that has aged gracefully. Yes it's on an old system, but the art design and music still hold up well like the classic Mario titles, and gameplay is solid. A masterful experience thats supplemented quite well by its sequel, Banjo Tooie.\",\n",

I'm not any kind of a game player but it makes me feel so good just watching their enjoyment.  Thank you for a product that is not full of all that blood and gore that so many of the games have now days.\",\n",
       " \"Banjo-Kazooie is a game that didn't really appeal to me at first.  It looked to childish, to easy, and just basically stupid.  Comming from the  epic company Rareware, I was a bit more interested in what this game was  about.  Seeing so many good reviews and so many possitive aspects, I  realized I must give this game a try.  Well, was I ever lucky to do so.  Keeping with the Mario 64 type control style and the amazing graphics, I  couldn't put the game down.  Even though the game was kiddie looking and  very childish too, it was really placed for us people who love adventure  games.  The little things, such as the mini games, make this game even  better than it already was.  Imagine running around in the snow in a race  against a sleding polar bear or playing follow the leader with a giant  ghost hand.  These are only a few of the things you can do in the game.  The game flows a little different than Mario fans might be used to; you  have many things to collect.  For starters, your main objective is to find  all the Jiggys on a level so you can gain access to all other levels.  Also, music notes are needed to break the witches spell on doors throughout  her lair.  And even little guys called Jinjo's are here for you to collect,  so they can help you on your journey, through a forest, islands, deserts,  and many other worlds.  If you have seen a Rare game, you know that they  have good graphics, so no exception here, very well done.  The music is  also a plus feature on this game.  With so many great reviews by people of  all ages and sexes, you would be doing yourself a great disjustice by not  buying this game.\",\n",
       " 'Rareware - words fail me. Again they have made a quality title beyond imagination. Creative beyond a shadow of a doubt. 95 % of people agree, that Banjo-Kazooie is a landmark title with everything the N64 has to offer, and that it is worthy of 5 out of 5 stars . While developed early in N64\\'s lifespan, the graphics stand out beyond many titles recently released. The sound is equally as impressive (for N64), and the game has been cleverly melded with it to make you feel as the atmosphere of the game has changed, depending on your situation.I am proud to say many people love this game. Many of my friends still play it occasionally, however few have beaten it all the way. This game is solid for 50+ hours of gaming, but only when you are willing to get every last puzzle piece and musical note, and every other item. Some people dislike it, and do not be fooled; a 27 year male old who listens to ultra-hard rock and loves games with extreme violence and/or nudity will NOT like this game. It is by no means for everybody. Many gamers, from preschool to high school will like it, but not everybody.The controls are easy enough to master, and any avid or casual gamer will easily master them with a little practice. The sound is superb. The graphics are good, for an N64 title. There is not a dull moment in this game, and the attention to detail is amazing. The puzzles, the meat of the game, are easy enough for older kids to have a challenge and not to hard for younger kids. The puzzle peices, your reward for completeing a puzzle, are well hidden. The musical notes, the only way to advance to the next portion of the overworld, are challenging to find. The most fun part of the game, visiting Mumbo, is quite enjoyable. He transforms you into various forms. A fat walrus, a termite, and even a bumble bee. There isn\\'t really an advancing story, but that\\'s okay. You get an occasional cinematic, but it\\'s pretty basic.The story goes...The evil witch, Gruntilda, is happily hanging out atop her mountain WHEN... The \"cute\" Tootie, sister of Banjo the bear, strolls by. Overcome with jealousy, she sees Tootie is quite a bit \"cuter\" than her. So she kidnapps Banjo\\'s sister and creates a machine to suck Tootie\\'s \"cuteness\" out and put it into her. Banjo and his sidekick breegull, Kazooie set off to find Tootie. A mole named Bottles helps them learn some new moves to defeat various obsticles in the game.Well, I hope you enjoy this game. Thanks for reading this review, and until next time...CRIMSON|RED',\n",

It\\'s a game for people that love adventures, puzzles, shooting, and the occasional flying. It never seizes to get old and the graphics are as good as they can get for the Nintendo 64.The object of the game is simple, Bowser has kidnapped Princess Peach, and you, Mario (the greatest Plummer in the world), must save her. Bowser is hiding somewhere in the castle and you must find him by collecting all of the hidden stars scattered throughout various paintings that give Mario his power. To find Bowser, you must climb to the top of the tower. Each floor requires a certain number of stars that have to be collected before you can move on. Every painting that has stars in them are magical paintings that Mario can jump through to transport himself to a different world were he can explore for stars.Overall, I rank the game a 9/10 for its creativity and several different ways it keeps players focused and entertained. The makers of Mario did a fantastic job integrating so many different aspects of gaming, which in turn made it so great. I hope that whoever is reading this can come to their senses and BUY THIS GAME!',\n",
       " \"Even though this game is almost 4 years old-it is still one of the best games that the N64 has to offer.  Why?  Well dear reader I will tell you why.  SUPER MARIO 64 is a gaming revolution,  it was the game that everyone had to have.  It took Mario into a whole new atmosphere.  The world that is inside Princess Peach's(aka Princess Toadstool) castle is immense and highly imaginative.  Although the graphics may seem a little bit dated(it was a launch game remember that) it is still a sight to see.  As far as play control goes, it is a bit difficult to get the hang of moving Mario around, but once you get used to it then controlling Mario is a breeze.  In fact it is some of the best playcontrol that a game has to offer.  The Super Mario 64 storyline is familiar to Mario fans but at the same time a touch refreshing.  Yes Peach is captured but she is being held prisnor in her own castle(in a picture in fact), and one of the funnest parts of the game is hanging out outside.  One of my problems is that Luigi is not in the game, in fact no mention of him is made either.  Nintendo should have left the Mario Party franchise alone and focused on creating a Super Mario 64 2, but alas they didn't.  So if you own a Nintendo 64 and don't have this title, or are thinking of buying a N64, then get Super Mario 64 because it is by far a true gaming experience.\",\n",
       " '1996 was a fairly important year in the realm of video gaming. The Super Nintendo Entertainment System dies out in the United States. Diablo comes out for the PC. However, the biggest news is the launch of Nintendo\\'s amazing new system: the Nintendo 64, which was lauded for its beautiful graphics and a brilliant new controller.Two games were released along with the system. There was Pilotwings 64, which was not exactly what was expected, but the other game was called the greatest game of all time (as of 1996, that is, at least in the eyes of critics) by several source. And it really was.The first thing that strikes your eyes is its delicious eye candy. The first thing that pops out at you after the title is Giles Goddard\\'s Mario face. And boy does it look good! But enough with the intro. It\\'s time to see whether the game itself passes the graphics test.Answer? Yes it does. Even after five years, Super Mario 64 is still one of the most beautiful games for Nintendo\\'s crowning glory (speaking from a fanboy\\'s POV.) The character and tree designs are very outdated by today\\'s standards, but the water is still lovely (though surpassed) and some of the brick and stone backgrounds still are the most realistic that I have ever seen. Today the graphics would get a C by reviewers, but back in 1996, this game would get an A+.But who cares how it looks. Let\\'s see how it sounds.The answer? Great! Before 1996, Nintendo fans never had a chance to hear Mario talk, but the first thing that greets you when you turn on the system is a jingle and the words \"It\\'s-a me, Mario!\" and \"Hello!\" while a remixed version of the classic Mario theme plays in the back. But again, this is only the intro. The question is whether games sounds that good.The answer, naturally, would be even better. Mario comes packed with a large batch of sayings including \"Mama mia!\", \"Here we go!\" and \"Press start to play!\" Unfortunately, everything else (other than Peach and Bowser) don\\'t talk in anything else other than words. But remember the fact that this is a first generation cartridge game, and if people complain for Zelda, then they shouldn\\'t complain here.The music and sound effects are just divine. Outside the castle, you are greeted with the happy chirping of birds and the roaring of a nearby waterfall. Enter and the cozy castle theme starts playing. Each of the levels come equipped with music that ranges from peaceful to energetic to somber. The Bowser fight music ranges from rock to organ music, and it\\'s all wonderful.Now that the graphics and the sound are out of the way, let\\'s get into the meat of the game: the gameplay.The first thing most people would notice is how different this is from traditional Mario games. There are only 1-Up mushrooms, and the only pipe that appears is in the very beginning. However, Super Mario 64 is 3D, and most of those elements just wouldn\\'t work in a 3D game.The story, according to the manual, is that Peach invites Mario over to the castle for a cake. When Mario reaches the castle, he is greeted with a gruff voice. Wondering what went on, Mario explores the rooms and finds a giant painting where he can jump in. There, he finds himself in a new world, with a giant Bob-Omb on the top. He fights and defeats it (you\\'ll have to do that part yourself) and gets a star. Later, he learns that Bowser has attacked the castle, captured the Princess, stolen the Power Stars, and has sent his army to take over the worlds inside the paintings, then the world itself.Yeah, so it isn\\'t much different from other Mario games, but that\\'s not the point. The point is, there are 120 stars out there (although 70 is need to beat the game, but where\\'s the fun in that?) for you to collect. Your misson to explore 15 worlds to find those 120 stars.Well, instead of having a Super Mario and a Mario like in past Mario games, Mario has 8 life bars. Hitting certain enemies would make him lose 2 life bars, as well falling from semi-high heights. Burning Mario\\'s butt will make him lose 3. Certain other enemies and falling from really high heights will make him lose 4. But don\\'t worry. Coins and water will replenish your health. If you lose all 8 or fall down a pit, you lose a life. But for every 50 coins you get with a star and every 1-Up Mushrooms, you get a life.Your moves include the standard running, punching, butt-stomping, as well as the kick, the long-jump, the wall-kick, the side-somersault, and the backflip. You can also swim! There are three special caps that gives you special abilities. The Flying Cap gives you the ability to fly. The Metal Cap gives you the ability to walk underwater and be immune to enemy. The Vanish Cap gives you the ability to walk through enemies and certain walls. Mario most employ all of those ablities to save the Princess and the world.The Nintendo 64 controller, with its analog stick, makes it possible for Mario to perform the tasks successfully. (Just imagine travelling in a 3D world with a D-pad.) Some people complain about the camera angles and how you have to control them with the C-button. It may be annoying at first, but eventually you\\'ll get used to it, and it\\'ll come naturally, and you\\'ll learn to play with the bad angles.Super Mario 64 not only has good graphics, good sound, and good gameplay, but the fact that it is revolutionary (in that it brings gaming into the 3D world) makes it not only the best game of 1996, but possibly also the best game ever. That\\'s right, even better than Castlevania and Super Metroid.',\n",
       " \"Super Mario 64 is a great game and is what I would call the best platforming game of all time.PROS+ Memorable music and imaginative courses.+ Game play is always straightforward and never confusing.+ 120 stars to collect for long playing time.+ Graphics were great back when it was made, and is not painful to look at now.CONS- While this game does have replay value, you aren't compelled to play again after you beat it. Give it a while and you will definitely want to play again.This game was not too hard for me, and I beat it when I was in the single-digits as a child. That given, it shouldn't be too hard for any age. Buy this game now if you haven't ever played it, since it is one of those video games you have to beat.\",\n",
       " \"I only bought a N64 recently, but played it numerous times at friends houses.  I've already got a PS2 with 38 games, and 6 for the N64, and have played god knows how many others but I have to say that Super Mario 64 is on my top 5 list!\",\n",
       " \"This game was the premiere launch game for the Nintendo 64 when it premiered and despite the fact that it is only a single played game, pulls off fun gameplay and great graphics. Despite the fact of newer systems like Xbox, PS2, and even Nintendo's own Gamecube, I would still be happy to have this game sitting on my shelf next to games like Red Faction and Halo. This game prved itself showing off the power that the Nintendo 64 had and showed it off to the loyal people who bought one instead of a PS-X and even those who (like me) bought both a Nintendo 64 and a PS-X. But, not to mince words I'll explain the game. You are Mario one of the most well known characters in video game history. You play through this adventure all in 3D. This was one of the true selling factors of this game as it was Mario's first true step into the Third Dimension (Hushed Gasp). But, the game sold great and over time has proved in it's own right that it is a classic.\",\n",
       " \"Super Mario 64 is a game I've wanted to play for ages. I finally decided to purchase it and I was not disappointed. In my opinion Super Mario 64 is the best in the Mario series and one of the best games ever. This game was a breakthrough in 3Dplatformers and it's easy to see why. The 3D is great for its time and the style is incredible.The game is addictive as well. I would play for hours and hours and wouldn't want to stop, and Super Mario 64 does not get tiresome after you beat it for the first time.The plot is simple, Bowser kidnaps Princess Peach and Mario must save her. But the plot's not important in a video game. The game play is what matters.The game is fast paced and you always have new areas to unlock. Despite not having any other areas to go to outside of Princess Peach's castle there are tons of areas inside. Getting to new areas is simple. You need a certain amount of stars to unlock doors, and unlock enough doors to unlock boss doors. Overall, there are 120 stars in the entire game and I would recommend a guide because of how challenging it is.When battling Bowser in this game, I was disappointed. He's so easy. When I beat him the first time I was surprised how easy he was. It was more difficult getting to Bowser than it was battling him. But all three incredible boss stages that were before the battles are so much fun it makes up for it.There are also hidden items, characters and power ups for Mario to find.Now there are a few problems like any other game that I think are quite frustrating. Mario's controls sometimes are a little tough. His wall jumps have to be so precise and if you mess up you have to do it again and again, and the camera sometimes can be tough to use in certain areas. But, despite these problems it's still a great game.This game is a must own for Mario fans. While yet you must already know this since I'm writing this review thirteen years later. : )Super Mario 64 will always be known as one of the best 3Dplatformers in video game history.\",\n",

Sadly, very few games came after it to give much competition. To this day, it still remains one of the best N64 games out there. The sheer scope of the game is enough to pick it up. It's made up of 20+ levels that can be played in a semi-non linear order. The graphics are bright and clear, and the animations are creative for each character. Gameplay is pretty deep, but extremely intuitive and becomes second nature after playing for a short time. The real plus in this game is the music, some of the most catchiest to be written for a game to date. Pick this one up for both its historical value and for the fact that its a great game.\",\n",

But I'll give you a little info:Title: Rainbow ride/ Star#2You'll have to take another magic carpet ride through low-flying areial obstacles to reach the cloud house. The blue blocks that float in your way are bigger on this carpet ride and you'll have to jump on them quickly before the carpet moves out from under your feet. The Magic Carpet will take you through the cloud house twice. On both trips, whatch out for the jet of fire that comes out from the fireplace! I'ts best to stay to the rear of the carpet until the fire is out, then go to theleading ledge of the carpet. If you get knocked off the carpet, it's a log trip back to a spot where you can remount it.( there's a warp to the top of the maze on the Cloud House Balcony.)\",\n",

This game like many other Nintendo 64 titles encouraged me to go out and buy myself a Nintendo 64 16 years after its release. I used to play this game with friends and cousins. Playing it now brings back such great memories. This game is what a game is all about. An unforgettable story, an interesting environment, and overall FUN. This game doesn't get old.

Too bad some companies are still completely clueless.To summarize.Perfection.Groundbreaking.A legend that spawned a thousand imitators, some good, most...not so good.Can't beat the original.Highest recommendations.\",\n",

       " \"For anyone who was a fan of video games, they remember the year of 1996:The Playstation made waves and drew many Nintendo fans away with its 32-bit graphics and CD based games. For the first time, Nintendo was being challenged on its own ground and they had to answer Sony with a console of its own. After they put the Super Nintendo system to rest, they went to work and released the Nintendo 64 to the public. The odds were against them because with only two launch titles to choose from, early adopters had to either pick Pilotwings 64 (a good game) or Super Mario 64. This game was the reason Nintendo's console immediately flew off the shelves and showed that Mario can make the jump to 3D and it was fun doing so.I'll make my review short because other reviewers had covered the basics and importance of Super Mario 64. It stars Mario in an open world where each stage is contained within various paintings scattered through Princess Peach's castle. The storyline is pretty typical by now: King Bowser kidnaps the princess and you jump in to rescue her. The graphics are colorful, bright and were a breakthrough in video game technology at the time. The controls are perfect and take almost no time to get used to. It's a pretty challenging game so expect to replay certain stages over and over again. So why did I give it 4.5 stars? The camera is not perfect but back then, getting the camera to work in any open world style game was difficult to program. It always centers behind you but sometimes gets a little wacky when you go up ledges or around corners. It gets annoying after awhile but you learn to tolerate it.What made this game groundbreaking was that games of this type proved to be a challenge to make and to make it fun as well is really the main goal. Super Mario 64 exceeds this and was a commercial success with gamers and gained much critical acclaim from reviewers of virtually every gaming publication. Those who say didn't like were in the minority and for reasons that were just too petty and silly. While gaming has changed tremendously since 1996, this game shows that the platform genre was at one point the kind of games that everyone wanted to play. And now, you can either track down the cartridge or get this for the Nintendo DS. So if you haven't played this, take a look for yourself as to why many gamers loved to play this game. I highly recommend it.\",\n",

       " \"I got this game MANY years ago for the N64, and I just loved it! The game presented a large challenge, while at the same time made it very fun! The music is the best heard in a game, the graphics are superb for an N64 title, and this Mario game is a blast! I guess the most noticeable feature are the environments that the game provides. Every environment that Mario enters is just awesome! I especially love the Rainbow level and the Snow level where all of the penguins are. The best feature is the fact that every age group can enjoy the hours of entertainment from the game and they can all enjoy collecting stars from each stage to save Peach and defeat Bowser. Oh, by the way, the Bowser levels are AWESOME! Fighting Bowser himself is very fun as well! The game is also good in the fact that it provides unsatirical yet not stupid humor as well. This is great for younger gamers. I guess the worst part of Super Mario 64 is the lack of replayability. It's like Vice City where it will take months to play and finish the game, but once it's done, you won't want to play it again without getting bored. Once the ride's over, you'll feel like you can't go play it each day, and the game is kind of wasted in that aspect. Overall, if you are a fan of Mario or Nintendo, then this game may just be suited for your needs! My rating-9.2!\",\n",

My only problem with this game is the freakin camera angles!!! AHHHHH sometimes I feel like I could just kick the Lakitu that controls the thing! Angles sometimes get soooo akward that it makes it difficult to make a jump correctly..or so you won't go flying down to your death. Other than that I give it a 4. Would be 5 if the camera was better.\",\n",

Honestly,  i had never seen 3D graphics before this game, so it was awesome and  inspiring.I love this game, so i'm writing this review. There are some  memorable moments from this game (like when Mario ventures into the haunted  mansion or when he goes on a rainbow ride in the skies)All in all, it  showcases the N64 incredible 3D graphics and the sound isn't half  bad.The levels are interesting and sparse ( i beat this game with the  Nintendo Power guidebook) and should take some time to crack the puzzles.  Basically, the game is quite easy and not surprisingly, it has enough  mini-quests and puzzles to keep you occupied. As for level designs, i think  it's excusable considering it's first generation stuff but still deep  enough to immerse you (again) after a long absence...My gripe is while  this game is really good (i mean i'm a big-time Mario fan from the first  mario game), it's only as good as it lasts. I found it hard to go back to  this game after a while- cause it was like having discovered everything and  it made it hard to play through the whole thing again.My advice: play  selectively. You need to get into the mood. While i say that, it's without  doubt that i have never regretted buying this game.Even if i never play  this game again and leave it to collect dust (not likely)-i'll always  remember this game as one of the finest moments of the N64 lifetime (that  is 1996-2001).Anyway, every Super Mario game is groundbreaking (SMB1  created the side-scroller, SMB2 was queer and fun, SMB3 is the greatest  platform game ever, SMB4 was one of the most replayed game i ever played  and this game is mario in 3D without luigi,which is sad)But cheer up  people- the next generation is almost upon us. But i know that when we look  at 3D graphics today, we will know that this game had a part to play in  making this our reality today.\",\n",

The worlds are massive with lots of vibrant colors, whacky enemies, catchy music, and most importantly, gameplay.The only downsides to this game are Mario\\'s horribly annoying voice, an occasionally fussy camera, and the possibility of graining your N64 control stick when you fight Bowser.

All other downsides merely point to the characters themselves: Mario speaks with a bad Italian accent voiced by Charles Martinet instead of his old Brooklyn one from the cartoon series.

Now Mario has far more of an offense rather than just stomping enemies, he can now throw punches, kicks and slide into enemies, making full use of the 3D plane. The enemies come to life in 3D, such as huge chain chomps, menacing goombas and annoying koopas The graphics could have been better, because they make enemies out of simple colors rather than textures like more recent games have.

The game has stood the test of time in several factors. One you can still find it brand new. Two the previous games mentioned are almost impossible to find unused! Three for a launch game the graphics were great, but they are not as good as late comer Banjo-Kazooie. The story line is interesting and the levels are big, but not as large as Banjo-Kazooie. You have to find 100 Power Stars that Bowser stole from Princess Peaches's castle, and if you get all 100 you can go to a cannon near the castle, hop inside, shoot onto the roof of the castle, meet Yoshi (Mario's dinosaur friend) who will give a super new jump and 100 lives! The games levels are challenging espicially the last few levels and the levels where you fave Bowser (you have to beat him three times) are DANGEROUS especially the last one. From the sea to land to desert to snow covered mountain and to the desert and beyond Mario must battle enemies in 3-d and collect six stars on every level. Five stars are attainable by completing tasks while the sixth is attainable when you collect 100 coins on a level. The music is hummable and the characters are nice and mean. This is still Marios biggest adventure and with the coming of the Gamecube and the fall in price for the Nintendo 64 and its games, Super Mario 64 is a must have.

My advice is that you should take a break from that level and play an easy,fun one.I wish this game didnt have so many jumping styles though. Mario Sunshine is a thing for us to look forward to but will at be an action/adventure game like this one? Is Bowser even in it?We don't know yet. The one thing we do know is that the Game Cube controller is easier to use than the N64 one and that the new Mario game's guide will be easy to look for. While I still say Super Mario Bros 3 is the most fun Mario game of all time, this one comes close. I prefer Sonic Adventure though.

Some things in this game are just too great for words, it's easily the game of the decade for the 90's, easily beating out Super Mario World (The second best), which is amazing. This game is far supirior to that overrated Zelda Ocarina of Time. I rate this game 100/100. It's Perfect!\",\n",
       " 'This great game is commonly overshadowed by the INFERIOR N64 Zelda games. If you have the N64 without this game, what are you waiting for? Buy this game! Super Mario 64 has GREAT gameplay, sound effects, music, graphics, and an excellent intro to top it all off!',\n",
       " 'Super Mario 64 one of the greatest games for N64.Story/Plot: the Story begins with a letter from Princess Peach inviting Mario to come to her castle for a cake she has baked for him. However, when he arrives, Mario discovers that Bowser has invaded the castle and imprisoned the princess and her servants within it using the power of the castle\\'s 120 Power Stars. Many of the castle\\'s paintings are portals to other worlds, in which Bowser\\'s minions keep watch over the stars. Mario explores the castle for these portals to enter the worlds and recover the stars. He gains access to more rooms as he recovers more Power Stars, and eventually traverses three different obstacle courses, each leading to its own battle with Bowser. Defeating Bowser the first two times earns Mario a key for opening another level of the castle. After Mario defeats Bowser in the final battle, Peach is released from the stained-glass window above the castle\\'s entrance. Peach rewards Mario by kissing him on the nose and baking the cake that she had promised him.Gameplay: Each course is an enclosed world in which the player is free to wander in all directions and discover the environment without time limits. The worlds are filled with enemies that attack Mario as well as friendly creatures that provide assistance, offer information, or ask a favor (such as pink \"peace-loving\" Bob-omb Buddies). The player gathers stars in each course; some stars only appear after completing certain tasks, often hinted at by the name of the course. These challenges include defeating a boss, solving puzzles, racing an opponent, and gathering coins. As more stars are collected, more areas of the castle hub world become accessible. The player unlocks doors in the castle with keys obtained by defeating Bowser in special courses. There are many hidden mini-courses and other secrets to the game, most containing extra stars needed to complete the game entirely. Some courses contain cannons that Mario can access by speaking to a pink Bob-omb Buddy. After entering a cannon, Mario can be shot out to reach distant places. When the player has the Wing Cap equipped, cannons can be used to reach high altitudes or fly across most levels quickly.The gameplay and control is fricken awesome u can control mario in more ways then 1.Power ups: Some courses have special cap power-ups which augment Mario\\'s abilities. The Wing Cap allows Mario to fly; the Metal Cap makes him immune to most damage, allows him to withstand wind, walk underwater, and be unaffected by noxious gases; and the Vanish Cap renders him partially immaterial and allows him to walk through some obstacles such as wire mesh, as well as granting invulnerability to some forms of damage.Abilities: Mario can wall jump, long jump, and many more.Music: the Music is all original nothing has been copied but the game music is awesome for each stage. In short Super Mario 64 is a great game and it deserves respect.This game is a must get in your video game collection. This game also started the trend where super games have 64 in their name for example Donkey Kong 64 Super Mario Kart 64 Pilotwings 64 and Super Man 64.Story 5/5 Gameplay 5/5 Music 5/5 Powerups 5/5 Overall 10/10 = A+',\n",

       " \"Surprisingly, when Nintendo created the N64 game system, they had absolutely no idea of how succesful it would be. The first game that the system ran on was also a scream. It just sometimes comes to me as a surprise that a lot of these newer games that run on CD-ROM like the Playstation 2, and the XBOX may have faster and better graphics, but not likely with the actual loading time.Nintendo's Super Mario 64, remains as the most dynamic staple of any N64 system to date. The graphics are just completely amazing, and so strong from one angle to another. In Super MArio 64, you guide Mario through 15 terrific stages with exciting adventure around every corner. The object of the game is to try collect as many stars as possible that are hidden in the game. Each star is very vital inorder to help you save Peach, whom is still known as Princess Toadstool, from the vile Bowser. Each course takes you from all depths of the secret kingdom, from Sea, to the firey sky, and even in a spooky ghost-filled house. The load up time for this, and every other N64 game is much faster than the CD-Rom games for the PC, and the other CD-Rom console games.It is kind of sad Nintendo stopped making fantastic games on cartridge like this, and traded it for a CD-ROM gaming factory, with the Gamecube. Nevertheless, Super Mario 64 is still the most superior game of the 20th century, and that is not even a pizza-faced lie.\",\n",
       " 'This is everything I thought It would be. It was the first game I got when I got my n64 and it was great',\n",
       " \"I enjoyed this game.  It was very fun.  It was the very first game I owned for the N64, so I didn't really understand how the controls worked but this game was really easy to figure out.  I love it.  When I walk by it in stores and see it ..., I'm speechless.  It is a great game, and by the looks of it, the price it down too.  This is definently worth your money.\",\n",
       " 'I played this game when it first came out at a friends house but i never bought it. I was not that in to the 64 back then. But now i think it is very fun and entertaning. The graphics r good for the 64, including that it was the first game ever for it. That is why almost everyone who has a 64 has this game. If u take the snes newest games graphics compared to this game, which is only a couple years apart, these graphics seem life like. It has a great adventure but its weird that Luigi is not in this game. It adds much more new items,charecters,and levels. I like that it is first person view unstead of the side view like on the past marios. Ever since this game most marios have been first person view. This is why i want sm64 ds, it is like the 64s but different graphics and differnent layouts. I will get the ds one in the future but thats a different story. Like i said, my top favorite game today.',\n",
       " 'Okay so when I decided I wanted to buy a \"new\" nintendo 64, my brain automatically said \"now where can I find super mario\". Hours upon hours were spent on this game when I was a tweenager and I had so much fun with it. So I went out as soon as I could and bought it again.I was kind of worried, because I had gotten some games with my system that I used to this were fun also but they ended up being a little too easy since I\\'m older now, but when I got this and played it it was exactly the same. Some easy levels, and some that take forever to get through, but in a good way.I have had it for a month now and haven\\'t gotten bored with it yet. So I recommend this game to people of all ages. I even let my 3 year old brother try it out and he had a blast, even though he had no clue how to really navigate 100%.BUY IT.',\n",

This game is good but that game is something you can't keep your eyes off. Remember when you finish the game and eyerything to do and ther'es nothing left to do, well this DS game has mini games. They are very addicting and fun! You can draw on this as well. The adventure mode takes longer folks. You can play as Yoshi,Luigi,Mario Wario. In The beginning of Super Mario 64,you could just walk in. But thwe DS version is different. You have to collect a rabbit to get in. There is more room's in this castle too with more levels. Instead of collecting 120 stars. You have to collect 150. If you don't have enogh money for a DS and the game but have a N64,dust off the original and have some fun. Or go out and buy your DS and game. Get whatever. You have to play this though. If you don't think I'm right,then you will be sorry.\",\n",
       " \"I think Mario is a  great game. Fighting Bowser is the funnest part in this game. The best part is when you see Yoshi. Yoshi gives you 100 lives. It's fun looking for Mario's cap when Mario loses his cap. The game is one of the first 3D and is very good game for N64. Even thoughGameCube has the best graphics, the game is very graphical game.The game may have many challenges, even after you get 120 stars. This Mario game is very fun for N64 and I have to say this is one of the greatest hits I've ever had for N64.\",\n",

The polygons are smooth as silk, very, very, VERY rare slowdown, and the Mario we know and love.Can anyone guess what plumber's job is in this game? It's to traverse 15 levels in search of Princess Peach. On the way, you have to stomp on Bowser's head. Thrice. All your favorite enemies are back, with the exception of Koopa Troopas. The goombas, shy guy, the Lakita Brothers, the moles, Bob-ombs, everyone's back!At a graphics standpoint, Super Mario 64 is absolutely outstanding in every way, shape, and form.

       " \"&quot;Super Mario&quot; is arguably the most successful and most recognizable brand name in the history.  It seems that every time Nintendo releases a new episode in the series, it hits video gaming gold.  From the earliest release of the original &quot;Super Mario Brothers&quot; on the original Nintendo Entertainment System, it has always been a hit.  Even lesser known titles in the series, like &quot;Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island&quot;, stay faithful to the series and produce very entertaining gameplay.  With the dawn of Nintendo's three dimensional, 360 degree rotating platform, Nintendo 64, the question became, &quot;Could Nintendo maximize the potential of this new platform and give Mario a fresh angle?&quot;  The answer, in the form of &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;, proved to be a quite emphatic &quot;YES!&quot;&quot;Super Mario 64&quot; takes the technique of 'multiple goals' for each level (introduced in &quot;Super Mario World&quot;) and expands it in a quite impressive manner.  There are 15 worlds Mario must navigate in an effort to free the Princess who is trapped in paintings in her castle.  The goal is to accumulate at least 70 stars to unlock the passage way the final battle with Bowser.  As each world contains 7 stars of its own in addition to 15 bonus stars around the castle, it would seem to be a walk in the park.  However, all is not as it seems.  Several of the doors leading the different worlds are sealed off either by locks or star requirements.  Therefore, there is a limited amount of ways to accumulate the necessary stars until more stars are attained or earlier battles with Bowser are won.  Of course, this leads to a journey through amazing worlds were Mario travels the depths of the ocean, soars in the open sky, battles over scorching lava, and even gets to sneak through a haunted house.  The variety of worlds and objectives are truly amazing, as are the new moves Mario can make to help accomplish these goals.  No longer content to just move forward and jump, Mario can now do backflips, long jumps, wall leaps, and crawls.One other aspect of &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; that makes it standout is its use of rotating camera angles to track Mario's movements through each world.  It takes some getting used to, but it enables a truly three dimensional feel.  This is game that Nintendo built its release of Nintendo 64 around.  It delivered magnificently then and, with its continual replay value, still delivers today.\",\n",
       " 'Super Mario 64 was and still is one of the best and most revolutionary video game ever made.  The game was a launch title for the Nintendo 64 and boy did the game make its mark on the console.  Sure we have games like Banjoe Kazooi, Ocarina of Time but this game was the first to come out and is still an instant class and started many many famous game rippoffs(Like many people say Banjoe Kazooi was a ripoff but I DIDN\\'T SAY THAT so don\\'t flame me!)but that\\'s beyond the point, this game is still one of the most beloved video game ever.  When Super Mario 64 launched with the N64 it was indeed a very revolutionary game, it was the first game to present 3d platforming, state of the art graphics and some of funnest/best gameplay you\\'ll see in platforming/action games.  The game is HUGE!  In Mario 64 you WILL be going through many, many stages to collect stars so you can unlock more areas for more stars and ultimatley put the evil bowser to an end and once again save Princes Peach.  I was one of many people who first played this game back when it launched with the Nintendo 64 and when you compare it to todays games the game(to many, but not me)looks terrible but you gotta understand, the time this game was released(96\\')it was INFACT the best looking video game ever.....period...and even today when I play this classic, it still looks amazing!  Call me crazy but I seriously still think this is one of the best looking video games of not only the mid 90\\'s but even today, it is still marvalous!  The music in Mario 64 was just plain perfect, the music blended in with the games levels and star hunting, words cannot explain how well Miyamoto and Nintendo did for the music,it\\'s just plain good!  The controls are also tight and well focused, I especially love the array of moves Mario has and although the controls may feel abit clumsy at times it never bothered me once!  As for camera, yes there were times were I wanted to break the tv but the reward and satisfaction of getting a star after that trouble feels so good!  Audio, controls, graphics are all A+ and as for gameplay?...Well it depends..Do you like platforming/action/exploring/collecting games because you will be collecting pretty much for the whole game(Stars, duuhhh)and if the answer is yes then this may be the best game you\\'ve ever played!  Now for me the gameplay was truly fun and innovative, I never got bored once in this game.  It\\'s so fun, hunting for stars never gets annoying or frustraiting!  Speaking of difficulty the game is perfect, it\\'s not hard nor is it easy like pie(acctually I take that back, for many people this game will be easy if you wanna just beat the plot)but it just gets it right on difficulty, I don\\'t remember ever being frusraited or angry with the game(then again I never did try to get all 120 stars)and just having a great time with the game...it seriously is one of the funnest experiences I\\'ve ever had with a game and as I said before....this game is revolutionary!  Now that I\\'m done ranting and talking about this game I\\'ll just get to it quickly...The Good-One of the best and most revolutionary game ever..period-Back then and even today it is still one of the best looking video games ever made-Loads of things to do-Not hard, but not too easy, it\\'s juuuust about right-The game is just plain fun, the moves, the platforming, collecting, ect-Collecting stars is really fun!-The music in this game is just plain fun to listen to!!-Though the bosses are easy I still think they\\'re just classics!-Will take a very long time to get all 120 stars, and collecting 120 stars means spending lots of time with this amazing title-The worlds and places you visit are all so different and an amazment to look atThe Bad-Some may feel that game is feeling abit dated now(the game is pretty old now!!)-Some will find the graphics to be \"terrible\" or just \"bad\" which I find hard to believe-People who just want to beat the games plot and nothing els shouldn\\'t even touch the game(because the game doesn\\'t take too long to beat for plot and if you\\'re planning on not having a fun time with the game and just wanting to beat the game and getting it over with, what\\'s the point of that?)-Some will be angry with the camera-Alot of people today or in the future may get this game and probably nag about how easy the bosses are well cry me a river, if you want a hardboss go play something els....other then that get ready to play one of the best games ever...Overall Super Mario 64 stands up on its own.  The game was indeed revolutionary and braught us amazing visuals, superb gameplay and great controlls aswell as a fun adventure/like plot with lots of collecting to do.  The games music was just great to listen to, the places the game takes you are just so fun and innovative and the moves/mechanics that are enabled for Mario(though limited)are great!  The game is just plain great!  As I stated before, it is one of the best video games ever made and it indeed gets a perfect5 out of 5 stars.....',\n",
       " \"The Mario series from Nintendo has consistently produced games that are refreshing and innovative, not to mention extremely addictive and fun to play.  First there was the original Super Mario Brothers and Super Matio Brothers 3 for the NES, to Super Mario World for the SNES, and now Super Mario 64 for the N64.  The game is 5 years old now, but it's still just as fun to play as ever.  The graphics and sound make excellent use of the N64's capabilities to create a 3D world that was just jaw-dropping in 1996 and is still pretty awesome today.As others have said, the basic story of the game is classic Mario:  Bowser has kidnapped the Princess, and Mario must rescue her.  To do this, he must collect a minimum of 70 stars from the 15 worlds in the game.  These worlds are accessed by jumping through paintings and other objects scattered throughout the Mushroom Castle, plus there are 15 stars contained within the castle itself.  Although you only need 70 stars to finish the game, there are a total of 120 stars available for collection, and you won't be satisfied until you have collected each one.  The 15 worlds have varying levels of difficulty, but each and every world has some easy stars and some that are very difficult.  It took me about 100 hours total to collect all 120 stars and rescue the Princess the first time.  Each level has a different theme.  Some are on mountains, some are in water-filled caves, and there is one set inside a giant clock.  My personal favorite is the haunted house level.The gameplay in Mario 64 is exceptional.  Mario has many different types of moves, ranging from tiptoeing around sleeping enemies, to a great long jump, to a very difficult-to-master wall jump.  You must master all the moves if you expect to get all 120 stars.  Also, there are three special hats scattered throughout the game that allow Mario to fly, walk underwater, and become invisible.  Again, all are vital for 120 stars.After you finally win, you might expect that you will never want to take on such a huge task again.  But, such is not the case.  Even though you have all 120 stars, you can go back to levels you have beaten and play them over and over, as much as you want.  You'll be tempted to do just that.  The experience of playing through the incredible world of the Mushroom Castle is such that you will be coming back for many repeat visits.\",\n",
       " \"This is easily the best game I've ever played.  I played it back when it was first released for the N64 and at the time there was nothing else like it on any of the other platforms. It led the way for 3d gaming which is of course the norm now.  To this day I still get nostalgic and pop the cartridge in on occasion just to run around in the various worlds. The graphics still look pretty good and the game play is still fun.  A simply incredible game.\",\n",
       " 'What a great game, I like it alot. The only problems I found were:1: It gives off way too many hints to how to complete a puzzle or beat a boss(EXAMPLE: On the first time you fight Bowser, he says \"Can you get behind me and grab my tail? I think not!\"2: Moving around is kinda stupid because Mario can\\'t move to the different direction fast enough and he slips on the floor when he moves.Other than these flaws, this is a solid title that deserves to be in your collection.',\n",
       " \"Right off the bat, before it came out, you'd probably wonder how would you ever imagine Mario in 3D. Well, here's your answer: Mario 64.There's 15 huge courses with 7 missions in each (Counting 100 coin stars), with stars for rewards. Those stars help you unlock more levels.At the time, no one ever saw anything like this before. Although the graphics look fairly primitive now, they were still eye candy for most Mario fans, especially back then.Super Mario 64 plays how a 3D game should be played like: With a free camera, flawless control, and extremely playable environments.Getting all 120 stars is the real challenge. (SPOILER ALERT) If you do manage to get them all, you get to visit Yoshi on the castle roof and he will give you 100 lives along with an improved triple jump move.Overall, you know what I want you to do, so do it. Buy the game\",\n",
       " \"Id like to say this game is surprisingly easy(thats a good thing) if you play all the cards right.I got in July of this year and beat it today.The game has great visuals and music and I cant be the only one who feels a tinge of sadness when the screen says The End.I get the feeling not because its a disappointment(it isnt at all) but because it was a real great game with a real great story.Thats also why I like playing it again and again.Nintendo 64 isnt the best Nintendo system of all time (that title belongs to Game Cube) but Mario 64 is one of the greatest games ever made.I feel anxious to put more N64 games into my collection.Ones like Ocarina Of Time,Banjo Kazooie and Majora's Mask. The N64 was slightly disappointing because there just arent enough quality games for it but Id be lying if I said it doesnt have at least 4 classics.Still the time has come for you to get a Game Cube.Namco's Museum is out for it so is Super Mario Sunshine,Metroid Prime,Sonic Mega Collection,Star Fox Adventures,Super Smash Bros Melee,Resident Evil,Super Monkey Ball 1 and 2 and upcoming attractions.Dont be afraid to buy a new Nintendo system but remember to keep the N 64 always.\",\n",

If only this game was a bit more challenging!! I think all new Nintendo 64 buyers should get this as there first game because you can explore alot with controls and skills that\\'ll help you out in more challenging games.Any fans of Mario, or Nintendo genre would like this game. As far as kids, there isn\\'t much violence in this game. No blood, or gorey actions. The price is pretty ok, and the game\\'s plot is pretty ok.

       " 'Stupid Sony... they forced 3D games out before anybody was ready. Nintendo was forced to cancel many Super Nintendo games (Doom FX, Star Fox 2, Mario FX) and release the Nintendo 64. Many popular 2D games failed in full 3D. Castlevania, Mega Man... they failed and have not been revived. Did Mario succeed? YES! This game is a legend. I heard about it in 2009 (not 1996) in a Nintendo Power magazine simply titled \"Mario\". I did not own a Nintendo 64 (this was 2009). The only system I had was an original Wii that we used for Mario Kart. I was somehow able to persaude my parents to buy me a Wii Point Card with 2000 points on it (enough for Mario 64 and Super Mario Bros 3). I downloaded it and was greeted with a happy Mario face that said \"HELLO!\". Soon I was distorting him to where he had no moustache and had big ears. Then I started the game and got a message from Peach. In her girly princess voice she read the letter, which told Mario she had baked a cake for him. The plumber could not resist and jumped out of a warp pipe onto the castle grounds. I had never played a 3D Mario Game. I stuck to Animal Crossing, Mario Kart, My Sims, and Wii Sports (I was 8 years old). After a little bit of exploring I entered the castle. Instead of a cake Mario got a scary message from Bowser (Who ate cake, I guess). Soon I was hiking up a hill to meet a giant king bomb complete with a moustache and crown. He told me (using fancy king words) that in order to get the bomb I had to defeat him. I defeated him and moved on to the next level, a giant fortress ran by slabs of concrete with faces. Then I started level 3, a snow level. What a level that was! Finding baby penguins, building snowmen, sliding down a slide. Then my parents walked in. My mom said \"YUCK! What are those dots supposed to be?\". Those dots were snow flakes. My dad said \"Are those graphics... 64 bit?\" I had not even realized the graphics were bad because I was lost in the creative levels. Each level had an original design with interesting puzzles and obstacles put in the way of the star. Each boss was different and interesting. The graphics are outdate, so what? This, along with Mario 3, really changed my view of video games. Now (in 2012) I have almost no respect for high-powered consoles like the Xbox 360. Kids should play these old games. How hard is it to get kids a $20 card so that they can enjoy a unique classic like this? The challenge is not too much. If you get stuck on one level you can try another. This is a beautiful game that put the Nintendo 64 to its limits.',\n",
       " \"When this game came out, it was like a historic event.  It felt like there was no longer a limit to what video games could do.  Every toy store had a booth set up where you could give this game a try.  It was amazing to play and amazing to see.This game is still amazing.  The play control is amazingly smooth, and you can make mario do some unbelievable things.  The worlds are amazing.  You can go wherever you want to go, do whatever you want to do.Just look at the difference between this game, and the original Super Mario Bros. for NES.  My gosh, the difference is astounding.  It's amazing how Nintendo could take something so great and make it hundreds of times better in less than two decades.  Sometimes I love progress.\",\n",
       " 'When \"Super Mario 64\" was released ten years ago, it was instantly the best video game ever created. Simply put, playing this game was a magical, imagination/mind-opening experience; almost a mystical one, in fact. This euphoric feeling and sense of awe that we felt the first time we played this game would never again be matched, at least up until this stage in the video game realm. What made it so amazing was the fact that Mario, who had only existed in 3D in our minds as kids, had now become like the cartoon character we watched on the \"Super Mario Brothers\" cartoon. The days of Nintendo\\'s rule were the great ones in video games, and it\\'s a shame that kids nowadays won\\'t get to grow up with Mario like us generation x-ers. Every Mario game, for me, was truly magical, but Super Mario 64 was truly revelatory. I spent years of my life playing this game (literally), and still play it more today than another other game available, for any other system. Unfortunately, this was one of the few true masterpieces for the Nintendo 64, and Sony took over with the PlayStation. For me, however, Nintendo and Mario are what video games are all about, and Super Mario 64 was the pinnacle of the entire industry.',\n",
       " 'One of the best games of its time, and is still considered by many to be one of the best games ever made. I highly recommed this game.',\n",
       " \"I remember the first time I laid eyes on this game. I had been hearing about how awesome the Nintendo 64 was going to be from schoolmates as we eagerly anticipated the USA release of this system. I remember hearing how in demand it was and the ensuing shortage for the upcoming Christmas before I even saw it. Then one day I was Christmas shopping with my dad and happened to come across a demo set-up in the mall, and I finally got to see what the massive hype was about.The game was bright and colorful, and Mario was fully 3D. A large crowd had gathered around to catch a glimpse of the latest in video game technology, and I only lingered for a moment, yet my first impression is still fresh in my memory. Mario 64 looked like nothing I had ever seen before, and also looked leaps and bounds better than anything I had ever seen on Playstation, Sega Saturn or any other system. I was very impressed.Several months later, I finally saved up enough money to purchase the system bundled with Mario 64. I loved the game dearly back then, and to this day I still love this game. It still looks, feels and plays unlike any other game that came out during that era. While Zelda Ocarina of Time is similar graphics-wise, that game is so great in it's own right that both games deserve to be recognized separately.Mario 64 is a perfect launch game for the Nintendo 64 home console system. Looking at the controller for the N64, one might have been understandably skeptical due to the layout. However, Mario 64 is actually very easy to control and is a good introduction to getting gamer's accustomed to the new feel of the controller and it's new button layout.When I say the controls for this game are very simple, I must also mention that Mario is capable of many actions. Mario can walk, run, crawl, jump, triple jump, backflip, side somersault, wall kick, swim, climb, punch, kick, slide, fly, shoot from a cannon, butt-splash, hang, hand-over-hand, crouch, surf on koopa shells, and even look around. While this scope of actions seems like a lot and likely difficult to master, the reality is that yes, it is alot but is not difficult at all to master. A few of the skills, such as wall kicking or flying take some practice to master, but the majority of Mario's actions are very easy to master, which results in very fluid gameplay and the sensation of actually being Mario.The camera angles are manageable considering you have control over them. You might find yourself slightly frustrated with it in certain enclosed areas (such as Boo's Haunted House) but for the most part, the camera angles are very functional. The gameplay is extremely fun with a very gradual learning curve. While you only need 60 stars to complete the game, players looking to one-up the challenge can elect to try and collect all 120 stars, which requires true mastery of the game.The music is outstanding. Koji Kondo, also famous for the Ocarina of Time music, did all the music for Mario 64 and succeeded in composing very memorable and enjoyable tunes. My personal favorite is and will always be the Jolly Rodger Bay / Dire Dire Docks music.The level design is unique with some truly large levels offering tons of exploration. Mario will find himself in sunken ships, caves with toxic gas, inside a volcano, a pyramid, in a desert, a fortress in the sky, sliding down slippery snowy slopes, and even inside a giant strange clock. This game is filled with fun challenges and hours of terrific gameplay. I don't believe I've ever met anyone that didn't find this game fun to play.No, Luigi is not in the game. There was a major hoax citing ridiculous methods that would unlock Luigi, but all proved untrue. Kind of strange Luigi wasn't in the game, but not that big of a deal.Mario 64 is well loved and remembered, but it is kind of strange that the Nintendo 64's launch game is almost incomparable to the entire library of games that followed. Super Mario World on Super Nintendo was a gem, but there were other great games in the SNES library. However, with the Nintendo 64, Super Mario 64 along with Zelda Ocarina of Time stand head and shoulders above pretty much every game in the Nintendo 64 library, which is disappointing considering that we see the Nintendo 64 was capable of supporting top-notch games. The Nintendo 64 library just didn't manage to produce games that lived up to the original launch game.In the end, Mario 64 will always be remembered as the revolutionary classic that literally defined the Nintendo 64-bit era.\",\n",
       " '15 years later, still a great game.This is a classic in every sense of the word.It not only redefined the Mario Franchise. it redefined 3D gaming.It is a must have it you still own a N64.',\n",

       " \"REGISTER NOW!UsernameBy now, many Mario fans have taken a look at either the Japanese or U.S. version of Super Mario 64, so we'll spare you (most of) the hype and rhetoric. Having said that, it must be stated that SM64 is the greatest videogame to date, and one which all games, regardless of genre, will be judged henceforth. Nintendo set itself a nearly impossible goal and achieved it with SM64. Look closely, Mario's lineage is 2D -- not ideal material upon which to base the most intensely scrutinized 3D videogame ever. But videogames are, in the end, meant to entertain. And entertainment is at the heart of this fantastic title.Like many previous Mario games, experimentation is integral to the experience of playing. You must explore everything, leave no rock unturned, no mushroom mute, no door unopened. Mario himself has so many possible movements, and the environment is so intensely interactive, that even the least experimental players will spend hours on the first level without achieving anything in particular. The game is initially less accessible than previous Mario titles, although the three-pronged analog controller isn't really where the difficulty lies -- the joypad itself performs excellently. Overall, the biggest obstacle in the game is finding the correct viewpoint. The camera, which moves on its own (unless directed manually by using the four gold buttons), tries to find the optimal angle to view the action, though occasionally you're simply not able to see where you're going. Additionally, frustration sets in as you spin the camera around while simultaneously attempting to run across a moving plank or tip-toeing across a tiny ledge. But getting the hang of SM64 is all a matter of practice , and as soon you catch on, you will execute these skills unconsciously. The variety of levels and scale each world is simply breathtaking. The game consists of 15 massive courses in which Mario can attain seven stars per course, with numerous secret areas and bonuses, including 15 extra stars (for a total or 120 stars). It'll surely take the average gamer 60 hours to reach the third and final Bowser and free the princess (not to mention find Yoshi), so the game's replay value is bountiful. And despite all of their saccharin-sweet cuteness, the graphics are magnificent. Shigeru Miyamoto's dream of producing an interactive cartoon has been fully realized -- the animation is lavish, the textures rich, and even the most superfluous touches have been completely executed. SM64 is not perfect, however. Despite the efficiency of the hardware's Load Management, draw-in is noticeable, and occasionally gamers will look right through walls or objects. Still, this is as close to perfection a game has ever been (64-bit, no less). Super Mario 64 also puts Nintendo's preference of &quot;silicon over CDs&quot; to the test, with pleasingly familiar results. Most owners of either a Saturn or a PlayStation (or both), have by now acclimated to long load times, though grumblingly. Super Mario 64 will remind them of how gaming used to be: load time is nil, and reaching a playable level is only a matter of seconds. From the time you switch on the unit until you're done, the flow is seamless, and moving from one game area to another is instantaneous. Nintendo's musical prodigy, Koji Kondo, turns in an inspired performance, somehow finding room on the small cartridge to create the appropriate music for each world. Even though some tracks are cheesy, others, like the sitar-laden score of the first fire level, are more than effective in setting the mood for the level, and are as atmospheric as any Redbook audio. Also impressive are the sound effects: Mario's onscreen antics are matched by grunts, whoops, and hollers, fleshing out his spunky personality. As a whole, the flagship N64 game more than makes up for any painful delay (or delays) imposed upon the unit's release. SM64 is complete in every way, and the challenging experience of working toward each new level is far greater than the game's minimal flaws. Nintendo's craftsmanship and zeal for creating fantastically enjoyable games has never shown through more than in Super Mario 64. Nintendo 64's early flagship title demonstrates the power of the hardware as well as the creative genius of Miyamoto and team. Not only does the game obliterate every platformer before it in terms of visual finesse, it plays just as well if not infinitely better than previous 2D incarnations of the Mario franchise. 3D worlds are huge and cleverly laid-out so that there's never a dull moment. Secrets play a huge part of the experience, recapturing the classic gameplay style of the series. In fact, this game is exactly as one might hope it would be: Mario in 3D. More freedom, more space, more options, better graphics, improved and elaborated control schemes -- it's all there. Possibly the greatest videogame achievement ever. Don't rent. Buy.\",\n",

I have won this game four times, all four as none other than Scorpion, my favorite MK fighter(4 times I won MK4! Perfect fit!).

The game moves just as smoothly and as fast as the past games so, those who still have the 'twitch' when it comes to fighting games, will feel right at home. I remember when I played this at the arcade at our local mall when it first came out. I went up against a 12 year old kid and got my tail kicked by him on it but I was tickled to just get to play it. I'm tickled it's out for the systems. Definitely worth checking out. Collect it if you can.\",\n",

       " \"Now I'll be reviewing Mortal Kombat 4 which is hated by some some do like it they The MK Team was trying to change it with the times & I'll admit it's not as good as Mortal Kombat II, 3, Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 or Mortal Kombat Trilogy it has it's problems but I like it. MK 4 came out in The Summer of 1997 it was the last Mortal Kombat game to be in arcades most of the principle characters return Liu Kang, Raiden, Johnny Cage, Reptile Sub Zero & Scorpion. Goro returns which kind of pi s  s  es me off 1 he's harder than he was in MK 1 or MK Trilogy 2 he wasn't even in MK 4. You fought Quan Chi as The sub boss. Jax & Sony are back.  Some of the newer characters I didn't care for like Reiko he was a poor substitute for Noob Saibot but Noob is a secret character he has no ending though. Goro is another secret character & he has no ending so it's pretty pointless. I hate Kai. Jarek is just another poor substitute for Kano. Ilike Fujin Quan Chi Tanya is alright. Shinnok is cool to play as. Story is Shinnok escaped The Neterreln thousands & thousands of years ago Shinnok was an Elder God he betrayed them he needs this powerful amulant. Raiden & Shinnok fought over it & ended with millions of people dying Shinnok was banished to The Neterreln. While The Invasion Of Earthrelm was going on Noob Saibot helped Quan Ch get Shinnok out of The Neterreln. Shinnok overtaken Edina takes Kitana hostage. Kitana is Liu Kang's love of his life all around good time girl. So Liu Kang helps Raiden. Shinnok has killed most of The Elder Gods except for A Wind God Fujin. Quan Chi & Scorpion have a history he tells Scorpion yes that Sub Zero is lying about being a brother that he ready killed his clan & his family. Also Tanya a new fighter & Reptile join to help Shinnok. Tanya's job is trap Liu Kang & have him killed & if you're seen her ending she does it's not official Liu Kang lives on until MK V. Shinnok agrees to send him back in time to his original race if he helps him Reptile is lied to again Since Shinnok is a fallen Elder God the battle can be won by Motals. Jax & Sonya are hunting down A Black Dragon guy named Jarek & if you have beat this game as Jax it's a really bad a  s  s ending. The FMV endings look better on The PS1. It's not perfect the main boss Shinnok I Quan Chi should've been the boss instead he's in most of the endings.  Nothing wrong with Shinnok I'll say this he's better than The Dragon King or Blaxe cause they were straight forward run of the mill monsters. But when you compare him to Shang Tsung or Shao Kahn he doesn't measure up. The game has a lot of in your face gore. This game got ported to The Playstation & Nintendo 64 & an expanded version called Motal Kombat Gold on The Sega Dreamcast. The 64 version has the advantage that it's a cartridge no load time but The 64 controller isn't made for fighting games. The Playstation version has better picture quality for the endings & you can get an arcade stick for it. I've never played or have Dreamcast but I've heard MK Gold is glitchy but Kung Lao, Baraka Kitana, are added I think it has Millena & Cyrax. I don't know if MAME will run it. This woulalso be the last game Of  The Boon Tobias era. Next is going to be an all time gulity pleasure Motal Kombat Anhillation.\",\n",
       " \"This game is a few years old, of course, but I was so pleased with it that I played it all last night after it was shipped to me. Definitely the best fighting game for the fading N64 platform. It is somewhat easy on the easy settings (almost too easy mind you), and as you increase the challenge level, the computer opponents increase in ability almost 10 fold.The only gripe that I have is that some moves are just not condusive to being made on the N64 controller. My hands also wanted to keep sliding over into the traditional n64 grip on the controller (with the stick and not the pad), but this game does not play well with the stick and thus you have to use the pad. That will feel weird at first. You can re-map the buttons to better suite your needs, but if you do, other moves will be more difficult to pull off as well. For instance, Sub-Zero's famous slide is almost impossible to do without taking your right hand off the controller and repositioning it on the correct buttons to make him do his slide. While you're doing this, you're getting your butt kicked because how are you going to concentrate on where the buttons are during the fight?I still give it 5 stars because those problems are not really that significant in the long run. The combo system is wonderful, and anyone who is looking for a good fighting game on the N64 console should pick this one up. With the price that it is at now, it is very affordable too. I highly recommend it.\",\n",

       " 'I had this game given to me for free years ago on the PC format. I liked it, but for some reason it crashed on me one day and I mustve done something to the disc, \\'cause it never worked or would reinstall on any computer after that.All these years later I\\'ve just picked it up, second hand, for the N64. And I must say there is not really any difference between the PC version and the 64 version, which is a good thing!The only difference is in the movies. The PC and I \\'spose gaystation version had the movies & ending in video form, where as the 64 replicates them the same way using the polygons of the 3d characters themselves. I have no complaint about it, I like it wether it\\'s video form, or 3D poly form. They both still tell the same story. Except Reiko who just walks off into a portal.. the other versions show what happens when he goes into the portal, he puts on his Shoa Kahn mask!!!! shame thats not in it.All the codes and moves where the same, and I like the fact that the PRACTIVE mode allows you to press pause and choose a list that displays all the characters moves, fatalitys and weapens etc... tho, i\\'m really kind of sick of the combinations of move lifts, which makes it great to just go into the options, highlight \"continues #\" and hold down block+run untill it takes you to the hidden menu where you can turn on auto fatalitys and stuff.The only bad thing I can say about the game is what it should have had included. It needed to be fixed so that the auto fatalitys worked like in MK: TRILOGY (All platforms EXCEPT the N64 version) where each button freformed a diffrent fatality (2 fats, freindship, babality etc..) that about it.This game is one of the best head to head fighter games. Unfortunatly the team at Crapcom decided to make a billion versions of Street Fighter for every other system... talk about over kill... but they didnt wanna make one for the 64, so thats there loss, which means Mortal Kombat is the best head to head fighter on the 64 if you ask me.This game is actualy converted to the 64 straight from the arcade and then extras where added in after that, which makes it better then the arcade. Like the fact you can play as Goro & Noobsaibot, and a skinless character named Meat (go to GameFaq,com for the codes)MK is the best head to head fighter on the N64 in this realm.',\n",

But I personally find the transition from 2D to 3D for this series scary at first glance. I originally thought the fatalities would end up being like horror movie scenes. However, I ended up sticking with it.In Arcade mode, there were about 5 or 6 difficulty modes. In Mortal Kombat on the SNES, I played well on it. In Mortal Kombat 2 on Game Boy, I was able to tackle Hard mode. In Mortal Kombat 4 for Game Boy, I can beat Master mode, but that version of this game was too easy. Here, I got my butt kicked even on Normal mode! The game is pretty challenging, but I think if a player's good enough, he can whop through easily.The gameplay is traditional Mortal Kombat fighting action. There are also some new moves, such as twisting someone's leg.The graphics are also really great, especially considering some of the Nintendo 64's limits, such as the 2D blood during the Game Over screen.And of course, the sound is top-notch.There are very few fighting games for the Nintendo 64, and this is your saving grace for your virtual strength.\",\n",

       " 'I picked this up the other day. It only took a few hours to finish the 1-player mode, but I suppose the fact that I\\'d previously played BattleTanx: Global Assault on PS1 helped me out a little.Story: Some virus gets out of control and eliminates 99.9% of the females on planet earth. This dude named Griffin is in love with this girl, and then the government comes and takes her away. Meanwhile, gangster militias that are armed with Tanks take over the US and likely the rest of the world. Griffin vows to get his girlfriend back and save America from the various Tank gangs.Gameplay: You play the entire campaign through in your stereotypical mock Abrams tank, blasting through enemy defenses and rescuing (or kidnapping???) women. Your tribal army needs women to stay in existence. Different gangs have different types of tanks. There are a variety of powerups for your tank like swarmer missiles, guided missiles, lasers, and gun buddies you can set down to defend areas. Most of the missions remind me of a multiplayer session of \"Capture the Flag\" from any number of FPS games. BattleTanx\\'s single-player is unique in that regard.Controls: They work pretty good. No complaints.Multiplayer: There\\'s no co-op campaign. BOO! :P You can play through various types of matches (most of which resemble the single-player levels) against friends or the AI. You can use the tanks of enemy games in the multi-player. That\\'s all good and well, I guess, but I know I can blow my friends to kingdom come. What I really wanted was to be able to play it through the campaign on 2 players.Graphics: They\\'re early N64, but they look alright. I don\\'t like the fact that your main tank in single-player looks so cartoony. The comic-style storytelling is unique, and I think they\\'re way better than PS1 Global Assault\\'s campy voice-acting.If you\\'re a fan of the BattleTanx series, I suppose owning (what I assume is) the first entry is important.

I didn't bother finishing it. I played the first five or six levels, I'd guess, and it was so easy and the story was so retarded that I just didn't care anymore. The multiplayer is where it's at. Totally intense. You play as different factions, each one with a slightly different tank set(there are only three kinds of tank--Goliath, the generic kind, and a super fast little one w/ only machine guns, the tankset just determines how many of each you'll get...some are only goliaths or the little ones, and things like that). Each faction also has a special starting weapon. Guided missiles(which are VERY good against base defenses since you don't have to go in there and get pelted) cloaking, shields, swarm missiles, etc.So, yeah, the multiplayer is simply amazing and the game is definitely cheap enough by now that if you see it you should buy it without question. Don't worry about the graphics. You won't notice when you're dodging guided missiles, goliath tanks, and mines trying to get the queenlord back to your base so you can win the round.Also, if you do get it, you might consider setting the control setup to DRIVER because the default control setup is kinda deplorable.\",\n",

In the game,you are Griffin Spade and you must rescue Madison from the Federal Relocation Forces(earlier reffered to as the National Guard). To progress in the game,you must destroy enemy tanks and bunkers,destroy enemy bases prior to rescueing the queenlords inside them(the last base is the Quarantine Zone in Snfrinsisco),take the queenlords to you're base via you're tank,earn new types of Tanks as you progress(Goliath,M1A1,and a minature one),gain ally tanks by earning points(note:you can't get ally tanks until after rescueing the first qeenlord),and gain Power Ups which provide you're tank with sheilds,replacement armor(if you're tank gets damaged),weapons,and ammo.

Plus campaign mode includes bonus rounds where you can earn extra points. Okay here's a list of all the multiplayer modes:Deathmatch:You must be on you're own against other players for this one,but you can get automatick gun terrets to assist you.Annilation:Depending on the gang you choose,you get a certain number of Goliaths,minature tanks(similar in size to gun terrets,and of course,M1A1's.

       " 'Yeah. So the story is very weak. Things are often like that for multiplayer-centered games. At least Mario Party had actually TRIED to spice things up with a story. Where\\'s the story for Super Smash Bros.? Where\\'s the story for Mario Kart 64? I didn\\'t think so. As weak as the Mario Party story is, the story isn\\'t important for a game...the gameplay is. Some games with great stories have fallen flat because of poor gameplay. Other games with NO story succeed with great gameplay. Mario Party is definitely in the latter category. You can hate the Mario Party series for its excellent \"Land Before Time\" impression. You can be among the groups of people that prefer Mario Party 2 and Mario Party 3. Yet there is one thing that you must admit. Mario Party was DARNED fun back in 1999! Sure, people said to NEVER play with one person, but playing all four characters as one person can be a blast as well.Anticipation may have been the first board-game video game for Nintendo, but it wasn\\'t exactly successful, and had relatively primative gameplay. So people now associate Mario Party with the introduction of board-game video game, and it\\'s definitely more like a board game than any other game before it. I mean, you \"roll a dice\" and move around the board encountering various pitfalls and experiencing different events. Although most of the boards are well-designed, I have realized that the majority of the \"board-game\" aspect is text or movement, and somebody watching a tape with only footage the \"board-game\" aspect would likely get very bored very fast. But what makes Mario Party the gem that it is are...the mini-games! Yes, Mario Party has 56 mini games to entertain all souls from all walks of life. Sure, not all mini-games are perfect, but you know what? Even with all of the blisters, broken glasses, and white powder appearing on the N64 controller, the mini-games are still worth it! Especially Mushroom Mix-Up and Running of the Bulb. Oh yeah. Those are great games. Mushroom Mix-Up provided tons of frantic fun and Running of the Bulb was hectic but exciting. 4-player teamwork games really need to make a comeback.Being a title developed by a third party (yes, Hudson is a 3rd party developer), the graphics in Mario Party are not exactly polished. Most of the textures are just simple polygons. And as was stated, the water is in the Bombs Away game is extremely pixelated. These graphics are not the ones that are so grand that you can\\'t help but go \"Uah,\" but why bother with visual aesthetics when the game is already filled with gameplay finesse. At least the graphics don\\'t hurt your eyes. I can\\'t say that about a game that game out 3-4 months after Mario Party...I\\'m sure you all know what it is. Sound. Sound effects are amusing, but not exactly something special. Voice acting is good, but I finally found out (after five years) that much of the voice samples were lifted directly from the Japanese version of Mario Kart 64. The music? It is fantastic! There\\'s a hint of Super Mario Bros. mixed in with the rest. It\\'s great to listen to, even if it is all just MIDIs. Okay, a lot of this is probably due to nostalgia. I can write a paper on nostalgia and Mario Party, but I\\'ll leave it at this. The bottom line is, even though Mario Party isn\\'t one of the technologically advanced games on the N64, it sure makes up for it with its incredible gameplay.',\n",
       " \"I've had this game basically since it launched in 2000. I must say, the graphics are rather impressive for an N64 game, and the gameplay is great. The minigames are fun, especially when playing with other people. The only real problem I had with this game is how it didn't last long at all. It has about 100-150 mini games, but you can easily beat the game and unlock them all within about a week of good playing time.\",\n",

There are other fun things to  do, like play in the mini-game stadium, shop for new games and play  individually to earn prizes.  However, one major downer? The rotating hand  games. Play this game enough and games like &quot;Cast Aways&quot; the one  with the light bulb, and the 1 vs 3 riverboat game will cause blisters in  your hand!If you like this one then check out the 2nd one as well for  more options, new board games and mini-games as well as new gameplay  features.

Happy to tell you that today, i'd rather play this game  than Tomb Raider.Well, it's like a board game but much more fun. Lot's  of minigames, lots of chances to shout and swear (not that i'm telling you  to) but it's all good-natured fun.The characters look kind of silly (esp  Yoshi and Peach who look like circus rejects)but i don't think the purpose  of playing a mario game (or any decent video game) is to see hunks and  babes.However, this game falls short of Mario Kart replay glory 'cause  the formula can get tired at times.But if you want a solid first-party  party game, then this is it. I haven't played GoldenEye 007 or Perfect  Dark yet- so as far as pure multiplayer mania is concerned, this is number  2 next to Mario kart 64.Yes, it's that good.\",\n",

       " \"I'll be doing the Mario Party games next and besides this one and 9, I have the entire series. 1 is the first one I played and still the one I hold very highly as one of the best ones in the series.The plot is very generic. Toad wants to test everyone and see who can be the super star and thus the game that destroys friendships begin. The original Mario Party is known for its difficulty in terms of mini games as the controllers back in the day were either unresponsive or some were just way too hard and required luck. I might even add that some mini games like the tug-o-war required you to twirl your controller to the point that it might even break or hurt your hand. Yeah some of the mini-games are brutal. On the plus side, there are some memorable mini games where you had to work together to win the game and personally we didn't see that until Mario Party 9 with the boss battle.The game overall had the most nostalgic feel and introducing the character's personalities through the stages. This game kind of set up Peach's obsession with cake and Luigi being the gadgeteer of the two brothers. The music for the stage is very cute especially in Rainbow Castle. I love how whoever gets 4th place gets the butt monkey treatment and attacked by the stage while 1st player achieves the mission needed.Overall, a good start for the series, but good luck finding this game. This game never reached the virtual console because of the controls so its a rare find in any trade in store without it being at extremely high prices.\",\n",

       " 'The original Mario Party is a must, as previous mentioned in the title, for any retro gamer and collector of classics. Those of you who have played Mario Party 8 or 9 for the Wii can now see the humble beginnings of this popular series of hit family games.Unlike Mario Party 8, there is a somewhat more interesting storyline where the six most famous characters of the Mushroom Kingdom (Mario, Luigi, Peach, Yoshi, DK, and Wario) are arguing over who could be the Super Star. After a rather amusing argument sequence, the six are placated by Toad to play a variety of games in order to achieve good deeds and become the Super Star.When held in comparison of the boards of Mario Party 8 and 9 for the Wii, the boards of Mario Party 1 are still holding up well. Naturally, the graphics are incredibly dated, but the design is a tad more intricate and focuses on gameplay instead of the visual style. The rules are the same for each board also:- You and three other players move around the board in a predetermined amount of turns- Play addictive and fun mini-games- Collect coins and (hopefully) a star or two- Try not to run into Bowser who will cause nothing more but trouble and steal your money or stars- And after each amount of turns play out, you get a cool little cinema of victory if you win.While I consider Mario Party 8 visually better and more entertaining, this game is still a classic and not just because it started the Mario Party craze. I love this game because the music is very cool compared to the strange pieces played in 8 and the controls are much more easier to use than the erratic unpredictability of the Wii-Remotes. All in all, a solid purchase.',\n",
       " \"The days when people said, &quot;We're having a Party, A Mario Party...&quot;  Seems to be long past.  When this game first came out, it seemed to be the only thing people talked about.  Yet today, with 5 Mario Parties in the collection, this one still is wonderful for being the base roots.Just like any of the other Mario Parties, you choose which character you'd like to be, Mario, Luigi, ect.  The object of the game is to go around the board and collect Stars.  Stars come at a price, 20 coins.  To get 20 coins, you must win mini games or land on blue spots.  This is like an advanced board game for the N64, but with a twist.  In addition to the board game aspect of this game, after everyone takes 1 turn a mini game takes place.Competitions in this mini game include:Everyone against eachother1 Vs 32 Vs 2This is where the intense fun comes on.  You and your friends button smash, spin the analog stick to your hearts content.  As a matter of fact, so much button smashing (fast taps on the buttons)takes place that gloves came out for this game to protect your hand.  Be warned, if you're too competitive with this particular Mario Party, you may wind up with a blistered palm or sore fingers.It's overall pure fun.  Games can last for hours and hours if you really want.  Though playing a board game on a console sounds dull, this game completely opposite of that!If you want a great N64 game...this is a must buy.If you are interested in this game, but don't want to play an older console anymore or don't have a N64, I recommend Mario Party 4 and 5 for the Nintendo Gamecube.  Exceptionally fun, with  quite a bit less dangerous button smashing.\",\n",

This is how you get in fights with your friends.The mini games are fun, not as fun as 2 and 3 though.Never going to regret buying this game :)\",\n",

I Have all eight games. I'm nealy 21 years old and I Love Mario Party!\",\n",
       " \"When Nintendo first made it onto the scene with Mario 64, they had no idea of how interesting it is to mold and shape the format of the Mario Brothers industry for the Nintendo 64. It became so big, that every single thing had to be topped off to the next level of excitement, and so on down the line.With Mario Party for Nintendo 64, they had absolutely no idea of how successful it has become. The game features your choice of six characters to choose from, Wario, Mario, Peach a.k.a. Princess Toadstool, Yoshi, Luigi, and Donkey Kong. The object of the game is to collect as many stars as possible by winning several different types of games including Tug O' War, where it is 1 player vs. 3 players, Bombs Away, where you have to try stay on a floating island for 30 seconds, without getting the shock from cannon shots coming, and there is Deep Sea Divers, where you have to collect as many treasure chests as possible, without losing your breath. There are also six different kinds of boards to play the game on, as well as two very special hidden boards, so look out.It is a shame that most games didn't seem to be like Mario Party. Although many people are interested in the newer ones and the Gamecube version, the original is always the best one to try for starters. If you really want it, then roll the dice and take that very first chance.\",\n",
       " 'Presentation:Back in the day Nintendo wanted another fun multiplayer game to create that doesn\\'t exactly involve racing and thus the first of many Mario Party games was created. Let\\'s see how they did in this new evolution to one of the most influential franchises in gaming.Gameplay:This was one of the first Nintendo games to include 4 player multiplayer and boy did people love this! Basically this game is like a board game, you start off with 10 coins and you roll a dice to determine where you go depending on the spaces you land on you can have fortunate things happen to you, unfortunate things, or you can end up gaining or losing coins. At the end of each turn the 4 players compete in a mini-game where the winner has a chance to win 10 coins. You want coins so you can have enough to buy a Star from Toad or maybe even have Boo steal one for you. When you\\'ve made a whole lap around the board depending on the time of the game Koopa Troopa will give you neither 10 or 20 coins. After 20-50 turns when the game ends youhave a chance to win bonus stars, the person with the most stars after that wins! The gameplay is a lot of fun whether you are playing alone or with friends. 9/10Music and Sound Effects:The music is very catchy to listen to, and the sound effects are good for the most part. The voice acting however is hilarious, nothing like hearing Wario yell \"DOH! I MISSED!!\". 8/10Story:The story is for the most part an amateur story. However most Mario games are, Mario and his friends one day argue about who is the best and they decide to find out who is through multiple games of Mario Party. In the meantime Bowser trys to cause trouble for the characters and they end up eventually defeating him at his volcano. Angered by this he tries to defeat them again in space, luring them there by stealing their stars. They once again defeat Bowser, and the winner of that game is declared the Superstar. The default winner of the game is Wario. 6/10Overall:Mario Party is a great single player and multiplayer game. And can be enjoyed by anyone of any age though the game is out of date I find this to be one of the best of the Mario Party series. With this I give this game an overall score of 8.5/10!',\n",
       " \"This game is so much fun! This is where it all started this game is one of the best mario parties. There's 6 characters who are arguably to this day still the most popular mario characters. There's 50 minigames and 8 fantastic boards!\",\n",

There\\'s SHYGUY SAYS, a game where you\\'r supposed to press whatever button he tells you. And a game which you can make a treasure chest come to you.GRAPHICS: Pretty good for an N64 game, the only other N64 game that had grat graphics was PERFECT DARK.SOUND: Great.

       " \"In Mario Party, you take control of one of six Nintendo characters (Mario, Luigi, Peach, Yoshi, Wario, or Donkey Kong) and move around a board as if you were playing a board game. After each turn, you play a minigame. At the end of the minigame, the winner(s) get coins. The coins can then be used to buy stars from Toad. Sometimes you run into Bowser, who does something random, but never helps anyone. The winner is the character with the most stars at the end of a set amount of turns. A true original by Nintendo. However, there is a major problem with the controls...As you may have heard, there are minigames in Mario Party that require rotating the control stick. Doing this can lead to blisters on the palm of your hand. In fact, Nintendo realized this and was almost about to recall every copy of Mario Party. But instead, Nintendo released a statement to the public that they would send a glove to prevent blisters if you send them the cover of Mario Party's instruction manual.I realize that there are many people out there that do not want to go through the hassle of having to do more than buying the game in order to play the game. Specifically, the people who usually lose the instruction manual to their games the second after they open the box. In this case, how is the person going to be able to get the glove if they could not provide the object that Nintendo was looking for? Nintendo should have found some other way to distribute the gloves. A way that would allow anyone who has the game, and cannot keep track of everything, get there hands on, or in, a glove.Nintendo should have noticed this defect and corrected it before releasing Mario Party. But don't let that stop you from buying it. It's still a great game; just don't forget to buy a glove!\",\n",

There are other fun things to  do, like play in the mini-game stadium, shop for new games and play  individually to earn prizes.  However, one major downer? The rotating hand  games. Play this game enough and games like &quot;Cast Aways&quot; the one  with the light bulb, and the 1 vs 3 riverboat game will cause blisters in  your hand!If you like this one then check out the 2nd one as well for  more options, new board games and mini-games as well as new gameplay  features. However, some mini games and boardgames in this version are  really great so give em both a go!',\n",
       " \"When i first played this game last Christmas, for the first time, i thought &quot;oh my goodness, how do you play this! &quot;...this is a  mario game but at that time i wasn't feeling too well and the strange  appearance of the game made my head spin.As a result, i played tomb  Raider:TLR insetad. Happy to tell you that today, i'd rather play this game  than Tomb Raider.Well, it's like a board game but much more fun. Lot's  of minigames, lots of chances to shout and swear (not that i'm telling you  to) but it's all good-natured fun.The characters look kind of silly (esp  Yoshi and Peach who look like circus rejects)but i don't think the purpose  of playing a mario game (or any decent video game) is to see hunks and  babes.However, this game falls short of Mario Kart replay glory 'cause  the formula can get tired at times.But if you want a solid first-party  party game, then this is it. I haven't played GoldenEye 007 or Perfect  Dark yet- so as far as pure multiplayer mania is concerned, this is number  2 next to Mario kart 64.Yes, it's that good.\",\n",

       " \"I'll be doing the Mario Party games next and besides this one and 9, I have the entire series. 1 is the first one I played and still the one I hold very highly as one of the best ones in the series.The plot is very generic. Toad wants to test everyone and see who can be the super star and thus the game that destroys friendships begin. The original Mario Party is known for its difficulty in terms of mini games as the controllers back in the day were either unresponsive or some were just way too hard and required luck. I might even add that some mini games like the tug-o-war required you to twirl your controller to the point that it might even break or hurt your hand. Yeah some of the mini-games are brutal. On the plus side, there are some memorable mini games where you had to work together to win the game and personally we didn't see that until Mario Party 9 with the boss battle.The game overall had the most nostalgic feel and introducing the character's personalities through the stages. This game kind of set up Peach's obsession with cake and Luigi being the gadgeteer of the two brothers. The music for the stage is very cute especially in Rainbow Castle. I love how whoever gets 4th place gets the butt monkey treatment and attacked by the stage while 1st player achieves the mission needed.Overall, a good start for the series, but good luck finding this game. This game never reached the virtual console because of the controls so its a rare find in any trade in store without it being at extremely high prices.\",\n",
       " 'The cart is functional and came as pictured. This is a great game for inciting fist fights and destroying friendships of all ages. Would recommend to anyone looking to end an unsavory relationship.',\n",
       " 'The original Mario Party is a must, as previous mentioned in the title, for any retro gamer and collector of classics. Those of you who have played Mario Party 8 or 9 for the Wii can now see the humble beginnings of this popular series of hit family games.Unlike Mario Party 8, there is a somewhat more interesting storyline where the six most famous characters of the Mushroom Kingdom (Mario, Luigi, Peach, Yoshi, DK, and Wario) are arguing over who could be the Super Star. After a rather amusing argument sequence, the six are placated by Toad to play a variety of games in order to achieve good deeds and become the Super Star.When held in comparison of the boards of Mario Party 8 and 9 for the Wii, the boards of Mario Party 1 are still holding up well. Naturally, the graphics are incredibly dated, but the design is a tad more intricate and focuses on gameplay instead of the visual style. The rules are the same for each board also:- You and three other players move around the board in a predetermined amount of turns- Play addictive and fun mini-games- Collect coins and (hopefully) a star or two- Try not to run into Bowser who will cause nothing more but trouble and steal your money or stars- And after each amount of turns play out, you get a cool little cinema of victory if you win.While I consider Mario Party 8 visually better and more entertaining, this game is still a classic and not just because it started the Mario Party craze. I love this game because the music is very cool compared to the strange pieces played in 8 and the controls are much more easier to use than the erratic unpredictability of the Wii-Remotes. All in all, a solid purchase.',\n",
       " \"The days when people said, &quot;We're having a Party, A Mario Party...&quot;  Seems to be long past.  When this game first came out, it seemed to be the only thing people talked about.  Yet today, with 5 Mario Parties in the collection, this one still is wonderful for being the base roots.Just like any of the other Mario Parties, you choose which character you'd like to be, Mario, Luigi, ect.  The object of the game is to go around the board and collect Stars.  Stars come at a price, 20 coins.  To get 20 coins, you must win mini games or land on blue spots.  This is like an advanced board game for the N64, but with a twist.  In addition to the board game aspect of this game, after everyone takes 1 turn a mini game takes place.Competitions in this mini game include:Everyone against eachother1 Vs 32 Vs 2This is where the intense fun comes on.  You and your friends button smash, spin the analog stick to your hearts content.  As a matter of fact, so much button smashing (fast taps on the buttons)takes place that gloves came out for this game to protect your hand.  Be warned, if you're too competitive with this particular Mario Party, you may wind up with a blistered palm or sore fingers.It's overall pure fun.  Games can last for hours and hours if you really want.  Though playing a board game on a console sounds dull, this game completely opposite of that!If you want a great N64 game...this is a must buy.If you are interested in this game, but don't want to play an older console anymore or don't have a N64, I recommend Mario Party 4 and 5 for the Nintendo Gamecube.  Exceptionally fun, with  quite a bit less dangerous button smashing.\",\n",
       " \"The first of the Mario Party games!It really is an awesome game. I only played it at a friend's house as a child really, so now, many years later, I finally decided to get it for myself, along with 2 and 3. The n64 games are classic.I really only play it by myself, but it is so much funner to play with friends. You can get so angry when someone steals your star. This is how you get in fights with your friends.The mini games are fun, not as fun as 2 and 3 though.Never going to regret buying this game :)\",\n",
       " \"I Got This Game In Excellent Condition In June Of 2003, But I Have Loved It Since It Came Out In America On February 8, 1999. I Recommend Buying It Without EVER Renting It! There Are A Couple Of Mini-Games that are not good for your controller and can blister your hand. they involve spinning the Control Stick. and you have to do so vigorously otherwise you'll lose. I Have all eight games. I'm nealy 21 years old and I Love Mario Party!\",\n",
       " \"When Nintendo first made it onto the scene with Mario 64, they had no idea of how interesting it is to mold and shape the format of the Mario Brothers industry for the Nintendo 64. It became so big, that every single thing had to be topped off to the next level of excitement, and so on down the line.With Mario Party for Nintendo 64, they had absolutely no idea of how successful it has become. The game features your choice of six characters to choose from, Wario, Mario, Peach a.k.a. Princess Toadstool, Yoshi, Luigi, and Donkey Kong. The object of the game is to collect as many stars as possible by winning several different types of games including Tug O' War, where it is 1 player vs. 3 players, Bombs Away, where you have to try stay on a floating island for 30 seconds, without getting the shock from cannon shots coming, and there is Deep Sea Divers, where you have to collect as many treasure chests as possible, without losing your breath. There are also six different kinds of boards to play the game on, as well as two very special hidden boards, so look out.It is a shame that most games didn't seem to be like Mario Party. Although many people are interested in the newer ones and the Gamecube version, the original is always the best one to try for starters. If you really want it, then roll the dice and take that very first chance.\",\n",
       " 'Presentation:Back in the day Nintendo wanted another fun multiplayer game to create that doesn\\'t exactly involve racing and thus the first of many Mario Party games was created. Let\\'s see how they did in this new evolution to one of the most influential franchises in gaming.Gameplay:This was one of the first Nintendo games to include 4 player multiplayer and boy did people love this! Basically this game is like a board game, you start off with 10 coins and you roll a dice to determine where you go depending on the spaces you land on you can have fortunate things happen to you, unfortunate things, or you can end up gaining or losing coins. At the end of each turn the 4 players compete in a mini-game where the winner has a chance to win 10 coins. You want coins so you can have enough to buy a Star from Toad or maybe even have Boo steal one for you. When you\\'ve made a whole lap around the board depending on the time of the game Koopa Troopa will give you neither 10 or 20 coins. After 20-50 turns when the game ends youhave a chance to win bonus stars, the person with the most stars after that wins! The gameplay is a lot of fun whether you are playing alone or with friends. 9/10Music and Sound Effects:The music is very catchy to listen to, and the sound effects are good for the most part. The voice acting however is hilarious, nothing like hearing Wario yell \"DOH! I MISSED!!\". 8/10Story:The story is for the most part an amateur story. However most Mario games are, Mario and his friends one day argue about who is the best and they decide to find out who is through multiple games of Mario Party. In the meantime Bowser trys to cause trouble for the characters and they end up eventually defeating him at his volcano. Angered by this he tries to defeat them again in space, luring them there by stealing their stars. They once again defeat Bowser, and the winner of that game is declared the Superstar. The default winner of the game is Wario. 6/10Overall:Mario Party is a great single player and multiplayer game. And can be enjoyed by anyone of any age though the game is out of date I find this to be one of the best of the Mario Party series. With this I give this game an overall score of 8.5/10!',\n",
       " \"This game is so much fun! This is where it all started this game is one of the best mario parties. There's 6 characters who are arguably to this day still the most popular mario characters. There's 50 minigames and 8 fantastic boards!\",\n",

There\\'s awesome characters (Donkey Kong, Peach, etc.) and the game is like a little electronic gameboard. with a dice, and spaces (lots) that you can trust.MINIGAMES: Great minigames! There\\'s SHYGUY SAYS, a game where you\\'r supposed to press whatever button he tells you. And a game which you can make a treasure chest come to you.GRAPHICS: Pretty good for an N64 game, the only other N64 game that had grat graphics was PERFECT DARK.SOUND: Great. Pretty great for an \"old\" game.OVERALL GRADE: A+So If you have an N64, then get this game!',\n",
       " \"In Mario Party, you take control of one of six Nintendo characters (Mario, Luigi, Peach, Yoshi, Wario, or Donkey Kong) and move around a board as if you were playing a board game. After each turn, you play a minigame. At the end of the minigame, the winner(s) get coins. The coins can then be used to buy stars from Toad. Sometimes you run into Bowser, who does something random, but never helps anyone. The winner is the character with the most stars at the end of a set amount of turns. A true original by Nintendo. However, there is a major problem with the controls...As you may have heard, there are minigames in Mario Party that require rotating the control stick. Doing this can lead to blisters on the palm of your hand. In fact, Nintendo realized this and was almost about to recall every copy of Mario Party. But instead, Nintendo released a statement to the public that they would send a glove to prevent blisters if you send them the cover of Mario Party's instruction manual.I realize that there are many people out there that do not want to go through the hassle of having to do more than buying the game in order to play the game. Specifically, the people who usually lose the instruction manual to their games the second after they open the box. In this case, how is the person going to be able to get the glove if they could not provide the object that Nintendo was looking for? Nintendo should have found some other way to distribute the gloves. A way that would allow anyone who has the game, and cannot keep track of everything, get there hands on, or in, a glove.Nintendo should have noticed this defect and corrected it before releasing Mario Party. But don't let that stop you from buying it. It's still a great game; just don't forget to buy a glove!\",\n",

When the game transitioned making it's way onto the Nintendo 64 I had to hail the calling of this game and buy it, so I did. The result? I was as happy as any person could have been after spending the money for this game, and it was worth it. The game is easy to beat, but, only on the easy route. There are hundreds of ways that give this game a replay value that could be unmatched at the time, such as getting medals for every planet in the &quot;Galaxy&quot; in order to unlock expert mode, or the ability to win tanks in multiplayer mode, or even be able to fight on foot. So, is this game worth the money you would pay for it now? yes, give this game a home on your shelf. Enjoy.\",\n",
       " \"There's a strong case for this title being N64's most replayable, with a heart rivaled only by Zelda. The arcade and score-based gameplay alone means competitive revisits, and you can absorb a complete experience in a reasonable timeframe, like a good TV show. Even with the kid friendly premise, there is a sense of true emotion between the characters. You care about Fox, his team, and the strife they encounter. Most of all, this game has yet to be topped for its kind - the closest they got was the 3DS remake, but even that isn't a whole new game (plus the voices were way better in this one).\",\n",
       " 'This game is fairly short and can be beaten in a matter of ten minutes on the easy route, but it does provide other secrets and ways to go about the game.  You can go through three main paths, but you can quirk the paths if you decide to or if you screw up on one part of the level.  You definitely will find yourself going back trying to unlock the different multiplayer modes and trying to up your high score.  The rumble pack is worked very nicely into to the title.  The voices are also a nice added feature.  Buy this game guys.',\n",
       " \"Gameplay: You play Fox McCloud, a fighter pilot for Starfox, and you're at war with the forces of the evil Andross. It's more or less a rail shooter, but there's some free-roaming flight to be had at various points through the game. One of the best features of Starfox is that progression is non-linear. Your actions in each mission directly affect how you proceed through the game. For instance, if you defuse the bomb on one level, you go one route. If you fail, you end up playing a different level.Graphics: You have to be a little forgiving of Starfox in this area. It's a fairly early N64 game. In the grand scheme of N64 graphical quality, Starfox 64 is probably somewhere near the bottom. But if you're turning down the new 3DS Starfox in favor of the old school one released fifteen years ago, chances are you won't care about that.Sound: The music is pretty good, as is the voice-acting. Although it lacks the polish and natural feel of some later N64 games with voice-acting, Starfox 64 still has one of the best uses of voice-acting on the system. Flying through space shooting aliens and talking on a radio to your teammates go hand in hand.There's still a lot of fun to be had with Starfox, even after all this time. I rented it and progressed most of the ways you could progress back in the day, and I'm glad to own it for the system now.\",\n",
       " 'There is no save feature, but the whole campaign takes a hour at most. Just sick with some friends and &#34;Do a barrel roll Skippy&#34;',\n",
       " '*The title is a quote from the final boss, Andross*A more accurate rating for this game, overall, is really 4.5 stars; but, of course, Amazon won\\'t let you grade in \"half stars.\"  A true masterpiece, Starfox 64 stands as one of the greatest games ever created for the Nintendo 64, and perhaps even all time.  I recently got it as my first and only Star Fox title; and, though I\\'m normally not a fan of games with shooting and space ships like this, this game succeeded in impressing!  Analyzing its features step by step, it\\'s pretty hard to find reasons why this game shouldn\\'t be loved:Storyline 10/10: The story is absolutely captivating!  Though it starts out pretty simple and generic (the galaxy and Corneria are being threatened by Venom, someone save us, etc.) the backstory behind it is pretty detailed, the intro is epic, and the story itself takes on a whole new life when you start playing!  Actually, YOU are the one who controls the story to a degree: you can pretty much decide, through skill and/or choice, whether things go great or awful for the Star Fox team, a heroic pilot crew you can manipulate.  You control Fox McCloud, and only Fox McCloud, but you also associate with the three pilots of Peppy, Slippy, and Falco; why, just protecting Falco and doing certain actions on the first level can decide which way the story goes!  This game does a great job of drawing you into its world and making you want to figure out what\\'s happening.Characters 9/10: I have to commend whoever came up with these interesting characters: they make the game!  Even on your own crew, each one is distinctive: Falco, for example, plays along the lines of \"the tough guy with a secretly caring heart.\"  Peppy is like the fatherly instructive type, and Slippy plays along the lines of a new school boy.  Finally, Fox, the same character you control, often takes on a reserved leadership role (which makes sense).  Each one has his own quirks; and, though any of them can be annoying on a certain level, you can\\'t help but feel a degree of liking for each of them.  Their lines, though perhaps epic for the time, can be somewhat cheesy and/or cliche (Peppy\\'s, \"It\\'s Quiet . . . too quiet.\" is a good example); but the cheesiness adds to what is oddly a funny and light-hearted game.  You often can\\'t help but think, \"I shouldn\\'t be laughing at this,\" but you\\'ll laugh anyway.  It\\'s just that kind of game.  The A.I. of each character on maneuvering is decent; but, until you get skilled enough, it can be hard not to shoot at them or let enemies get them, as they get in your way at the oddest times (then fuss at you when you do hit them).  Peppy occasionally gives advice that doesn\\'t particularly help either, though it hardly ever hurts if you follow it.  Speaking of advice, though, the game can make you depend on your characters if you\\'re newer at it, as they can each do something useful: Peppy gives advice and often tells you where to shoot, Slippy analyzes boss health meters, and Falco often covers you.  If someone gets shot down, you\\'ll miss him.  Finally, the characters are also pretty life-like in behavior: try shooting down enemies that Falco is chasing on some levels, and listen to his reaction to it.Graphics 9/10: Some issues with fog (common for Nintendo 64 games), but otherwise absolutely beautiful.  The fog itself, even, can be justified, as you spend most of your time in the air.  Though many stages take either a purely generic \"spacial\" theme, such as the asteroid field, the planets are really intuitive.  In this game you can find a volcanic environment, which even mimics the \"wavy\" effects of heat, an ocean environment (full of fish and plant life), a couple of cities, a train depot . . . the works!  The most interesting graphics you could see, however, has to be the part of the asteroid field you can \"warp\" to.  Though it probably looks like you\\'ve taken a medication or something else you shouldn\\'t have, you can\\'t deny the mysterious beauty of that point in the level. . . . Please note, however, that what levels you see depends on what paths through the game you take; like the story, it\\'s dependent upon your actions in the levels.Mechanics 9/10: This covers things like controls, ability to save, and learning curve (whether it\\'s easy or hard to master).  The controls, though they work well, are pretty complicated to learn.  This complication, however, is eased by the nice training mode they threw in; a few rounds in training mode, and you\\'ll pretty much have them down!  The game can still be pretty tough to a degree, though; however, I was able to nearly make it through the entire game on one of my first three rounds (and I\\'m usually not too hot at games like this), before the Star Wolf team finished me off (they\\'re pretty tough if you don\\'t know how to handle them right).  Make sure to master the somersault maneuver; I\\'ve never seen a game force you to rely on it as heavily as this one!  In terms of saving, I was disappointed: there\\'s no way to save; and, unlike what some people say, there\\'s no password feature either.  You\\'ll probably get sick of the first level for that reason.  While it\\'s not a deal breaker, this game isn\\'t for the busy person who\\'s looking to play for only an hour or less and quit.  If you want to experience the true value of this game, you\\'d better set aside at least a couple of hours for it.  The lack of a save feature is the biggest thing that kept me from giving this game a perfect score, as I kept catching myself thinking, \"This game would be perfect if only it had a save feature!\"Music and Sound 10/10: No complaints in the music and sound department!  It pretty much captures the mood, be it suspenseful, hopeful, dramatic, or even rewarding.  The character voices are also well done, awesomely portraying the character personalities as well.  I can\\'t describe any of this justly, though; you\\'ll have to listen for yourself!Conclusion: Star Fox 64 is a face of near perfection, if only a few small blemishes hadn\\'t reared their ugly heads.  Multiplayer, I hear, is lacking; but, overall, none of the minor flaws in this game are major dealbreakers.  Personally, I recommend this game to people who are bored and have a lot of time on their hands; the replay value is great with its various paths!  The final boss can be downright creepy, and . . . well, I think any critique could easily go on forever!  Long story short, this game is an absolute steal at the cheap price it\\'s at now.  A fond memory in many gamers hearts, this Star Fox 64 still remains as a highly recommended game to play!',\n",

Anyways, this game was put out 8 years ago and still every once and a while I decide to play this and I love it, cuase it has the talking animals on it.  I\\'m going to repeat this TALKING ANIMALS!  Slippy gets on my nerves though I just kill him becuase he always gets some guy on his ass and keeps bleating \"get this guy off my fox!\"  I wanna crack his skull everytime he says that it pisses me off.

HECK NO!  Anyways I hope you love this game as much as I do, becuase I say those lines everyday before I go to sleep, cause it bring hope.

       " \"In 1997, Nintendo was on the cutting edge in the video gaming industry. The Nintendo 64 proved that no mateer what a CD-ROM gaming system was able to do, a cartridged based gaming system could do better. That June, the case really proved the theory with the release of Starfox 64. The game was the very first to incorporate Nintendo's Rumple Pak, a force-feedback device that let's players feel each and every vibration at hand.In the game, you play Fox McCloud, a young determined fighter pilot who is sent on several missions to destroy Andross, a inane, mad genius that demands full control of the Lylat system. There are 15 remarkable stages that let you encounter in the entire game, alone over twenty-five different paths you decide on your way to Andross. The graphics are so realistic and full of promise, that you see the game so vividly, you feel like you're a part of it. In Starfox 64, you also have the use of 3 different vehicles, depending on your course, Arwing, Landmaster Tank, or the Blue Marine sub, only used in the Aquas sea level. The game also has a fierce battle level, for up to 4 players, where you shoot down your fellow squadron leaders, Peppy, Falco, and Slippy.It took nearly two years for other companies to develop the feel of the game, the exact same way Nintendo did with Starfox 64. The game is exactly one of a kind in the pilot seat. While Nintendo stopped releasing the Rumble Pak with the game nearly six months later, Starfox 64 is still truly a Nintendo gamer's paradise.\",\n",
       " \"Star Fox 64 is one of the most fun games I've ever played. It was one of the first N64 games to utilize the Rumble Pak (it was also one of the first to include voices for all the characters). The premise of the game is simple: you, as Star Fox, are trying to save the solar system from the evil Andross. To do this, you hop in your space ship and blow tons of enemy crafts to bits. The game is simple but fun and can be replayed over and over. I've played through Star Fox 64 more times than any other game I've ever owned.The Good:The Gameplay is fast paced, simple and fun.

       " 'Star Fox on the SNES... Not the best space shooter. Star Fox on the Nintendo 64? 2ND BEST GAME ON THAT SYSTEM (The first is Ocarina of Time)! Every level was packed with thrilling action! On the first level I enjoyed an easy ride along Corneria, gliding across the lakes listening to Peppy complain. The 2nd level (Meteo) really picked up the pace, and the drama was incredible for the Nintendo 64. The level opens with Peppy saying \"It\\'s quiet. Too quiet.\", quickly followed by, \"LOOK OUT IT IS A TRAP!!!!\", followed by a hoard of enemies, then giant meteors, ending with the most disturbing thing I\\'ve ever seen in a video game. A giant space craft swoops down and a monkey with a british accent says \"I can not allow you to go any further\". After a short time the british monkey says \"I am no match for you. I admit defeat.\" The whole game goes silent, and then the monkey yells \"IF THIS DOES NOT WORK!!!!!!!!\". He fires a huge amount of lasers, and then calls me scum after I defeat him. Time for Level 3! This one was also disturbing, but provided the greatest thrill I had ever had. The Star Wolf team comes in, saying some very creepy comments while they beat me. \"You\\'ll be with your dad soon Fox!\" (Fox\\'s dad is dead), \"I\\'m going to bust you up REAAALLL good!\" (says the pig who betrayed Fox\\'s dad), and \"Go back to the pond, Froggy.\". Then, right in the middle of that big fight, the robot assistant comes in and says \"DANGER! A bomb has been discovered in the base!

When the game transitioned making it's way onto the Nintendo 64 I had to hail the calling of this game and buy it, so I did. The result? I was as happy as any person could have been after spending the money for this game, and it was worth it. The game is easy to beat, but, only on the easy route. There are hundreds of ways that give this game a replay value that could be unmatched at the time, such as getting medals for every planet in the &quot;Galaxy&quot; in order to unlock expert mode, or the ability to win tanks in multiplayer mode, or even be able to fight on foot. So, is this game worth the money you would pay for it now? yes, give this game a home on your shelf. Enjoy.\",\n",

The arcade and score-based gameplay alone means competitive revisits, and you can absorb a complete experience in a reasonable timeframe, like a good TV show. Even with the kid friendly premise, there is a sense of true emotion between the characters. You care about Fox, his team, and the strife they encounter. Most of all, this game has yet to be topped for its kind - the closest they got was the 3DS remake, but even that isn't a whole new game (plus the voices were way better in this one).\",\n",

You definitely will find yourself going back trying to unlock the different multiplayer modes and trying to up your high score.  The rumble pack is worked very nicely into to the title.  The voices are also a nice added feature.  Buy this game guys.',\n",
       " \"Gameplay: You play Fox McCloud, a fighter pilot for Starfox, and you're at war with the forces of the evil Andross. It's more or less a rail shooter, but there's some free-roaming flight to be had at various points through the game. One of the best features of Starfox is that progression is non-linear. Your actions in each mission directly affect how you proceed through the game. For instance, if you defuse the bomb on one level, you go one route. If you fail, you end up playing a different level.Graphics: You have to be a little forgiving of Starfox in this area. It's a fairly early N64 game. In the grand scheme of N64 graphical quality, Starfox 64 is probably somewhere near the bottom. But if you're turning down the new 3DS Starfox in favor of the old school one released fifteen years ago, chances are you won't care about that.Sound: The music is pretty good, as is the voice-acting. Although it lacks the polish and natural feel of some later N64 games with voice-acting, Starfox 64 still has one of the best uses of voice-acting on the system. Flying through space shooting aliens and talking on a radio to your teammates go hand in hand.There's still a lot of fun to be had with Starfox, even after all this time. I rented it and progressed most of the ways you could progress back in the day, and I'm glad to own it for the system now.\",\n",

       " '*The title is a quote from the final boss, Andross*A more accurate rating for this game, overall, is really 4.5 stars; but, of course, Amazon won\\'t let you grade in \"half stars.\"  A true masterpiece, Starfox 64 stands as one of the greatest games ever created for the Nintendo 64, and perhaps even all time.  I recently got it as my first and only Star Fox title; and, though I\\'m normally not a fan of games with shooting and space ships like this, this game succeeded in impressing!  Analyzing its features step by step, it\\'s pretty hard to find reasons why this game shouldn\\'t be loved:Storyline 10/10: The story is absolutely captivating!  Though it starts out pretty simple and generic (the galaxy and Corneria are being threatened by Venom, someone save us, etc.) the backstory behind it is pretty detailed, the intro is epic, and the story itself takes on a whole new life when you start playing!  Actually, YOU are the one who controls the story to a degree: you can pretty much decide, through skill and/or choice, whether things go great or awful for the Star Fox team, a heroic pilot crew you can manipulate.  You control Fox McCloud, and only Fox McCloud, but you also associate with the three pilots of Peppy, Slippy, and Falco; why, just protecting Falco and doing certain actions on the first level can decide which way the story goes!  This game does a great job of drawing you into its world and making you want to figure out what\\'s happening.Characters 9/10: I have to commend whoever came up with these interesting characters: they make the game!  Even on your own crew, each one is distinctive: Falco, for example, plays along the lines of \"the tough guy with a secretly caring heart.\"  Peppy is like the fatherly instructive type, and Slippy plays along the lines of a new school boy.  Finally, Fox, the same character you control, often takes on a reserved leadership role (which makes sense).  Each one has his own quirks; and, though any of them can be annoying on a certain level, you can\\'t help but feel a degree of liking for each of them.  Their lines, though perhaps epic for the time, can be somewhat cheesy and/or cliche (Peppy\\'s, \"It\\'s Quiet . . . too quiet.\" is a good example); but the cheesiness adds to what is oddly a funny and light-hearted game.  You often can\\'t help but think, \"I shouldn\\'t be laughing at this,\" but you\\'ll laugh anyway.  It\\'s just that kind of game.  The A.I. of each character on maneuvering is decent; but, until you get skilled enough, it can be hard not to shoot at them or let enemies get them, as they get in your way at the oddest times (then fuss at you when you do hit them).  Peppy occasionally gives advice that doesn\\'t particularly help either, though it hardly ever hurts if you follow it.  Speaking of advice, though, the game can make you depend on your characters if you\\'re newer at it, as they can each do something useful: Peppy gives advice and often tells you where to shoot, Slippy analyzes boss health meters, and Falco often covers you.  If someone gets shot down, you\\'ll miss him.  Finally, the characters are also pretty life-like in behavior: try shooting down enemies that Falco is chasing on some levels, and listen to his reaction to it.Graphics 9/10: Some issues with fog (common for Nintendo 64 games), but otherwise absolutely beautiful.  The fog itself, even, can be justified, as you spend most of your time in the air.  Though many stages take either a purely generic \"spacial\" theme, such as the asteroid field, the planets are really intuitive.  In this game you can find a volcanic environment, which even mimics the \"wavy\" effects of heat, an ocean environment (full of fish and plant life), a couple of cities, a train depot . . . the works!  The most interesting graphics you could see, however, has to be the part of the asteroid field you can \"warp\" to.  Though it probably looks like you\\'ve taken a medication or something else you shouldn\\'t have, you can\\'t deny the mysterious beauty of that point in the level. . . . Please note, however, that what levels you see depends on what paths through the game you take; like the story, it\\'s dependent upon your actions in the levels.Mechanics 9/10: This covers things like controls, ability to save, and learning curve (whether it\\'s easy or hard to master).  The controls, though they work well, are pretty complicated to learn.  This complication, however, is eased by the nice training mode they threw in; a few rounds in training mode, and you\\'ll pretty much have them down!  The game can still be pretty tough to a degree, though; however, I was able to nearly make it through the entire game on one of my first three rounds (and I\\'m usually not too hot at games like this), before the Star Wolf team finished me off (they\\'re pretty tough if you don\\'t know how to handle them right).  Make sure to master the somersault maneuver; I\\'ve never seen a game force you to rely on it as heavily as this one!  In terms of saving, I was disappointed: there\\'s no way to save; and, unlike what some people say, there\\'s no password feature either.  You\\'ll probably get sick of the first level for that reason.  While it\\'s not a deal breaker, this game isn\\'t for the busy person who\\'s looking to play for only an hour or less and quit.  If you want to experience the true value of this game, you\\'d better set aside at least a couple of hours for it.  The lack of a save feature is the biggest thing that kept me from giving this game a perfect score, as I kept catching myself thinking, \"This game would be perfect if only it had a save feature!\"Music and Sound 10/10: No complaints in the music and sound department!  It pretty much captures the mood, be it suspenseful, hopeful, dramatic, or even rewarding.  The character voices are also well done, awesomely portraying the character personalities as well.  I can\\'t describe any of this justly, though; you\\'ll have to listen for yourself!Conclusion: Star Fox 64 is a face of near perfection, if only a few small blemishes hadn\\'t reared their ugly heads.  Multiplayer, I hear, is lacking; but, overall, none of the minor flaws in this game are major dealbreakers.  Personally, I recommend this game to people who are bored and have a lot of time on their hands; the replay value is great with its various paths!  The final boss can be downright creepy, and . . . well, I think any critique could easily go on forever!  Long story short, this game is an absolute steal at the cheap price it\\'s at now.  A fond memory in many gamers hearts, this Star Fox 64 still remains as a highly recommended game to play!',\n",

Anyways, this game was put out 8 years ago and still every once and a while I decide to play this and I love it, cuase it has the talking animals on it.  I\\'m going to repeat this TALKING ANIMALS!  Slippy gets on my nerves though I just kill him becuase he always gets some guy on his ass and keeps bleating \"get this guy off my fox!\"  I wanna crack his skull everytime he says that it pisses me off.  Then theres that stupid chick that knows Falco (the bad ass of course) and she is annoying, I wish I could kill her becuase when you go to the Z zone she steals your kills so you can\\'t get the freaking medal I HATE HER!  It is so annoying that she steals your kills!  Oh that has to be the worst part of the game, it\\'s woefully madening.  Also to not are the apes who try to kill you, though they make the noble animal of the ape villanious they still have memoriable lines like \"ANDROSS I\\'VE FAILED YOU!!!\"  Then there is team wolf, they are tottaly bad!  They are pretty hard to kill on the other side of venom but like I said if you got the skills you may one day beat them (and you say this game is too easy!  OH MY GOSH!).  Anyways I do like the bunny guy what\\'s his name?  I forgot but he\\'s like \"Your the best Slippy.\" and that makes me want to cry becuase they are always so hard on Slippy!  I love it that they actually give him love in Aquos cuase I\\'ve heard the stories, poor Slippy.  Anyways Fox is a stud of course, damn he is looking good!  He works hard of course, cuase I\\'m controlling him.  Anyways the best characters are the bosses cuase they say stuff to you that\\'s funny like that one boss \"admits defeat\" but then comes back after you cuase he was lying, what did you think you\\'d get off that easy!  HECK NO!  Anyways I hope you love this game as much as I do, becuase I say those lines everyday before I go to sleep, cause it bring hope.  Especially when the Bunny guy affectionatly tells Fox \"your becoming more like your father.\" Fox\\'s father was a pimp too!  That\\'s the ultimate compliment in the Lylat system!  I\\'m sure Fox shed a tear when he heard that from his bunny partner.  I\\'m out, only a loser doesn\\'t like this game cuase he is a nerd with no sense of humor who wants to play a \"real\" flight simulator.  YEAH!',\n",
       " \"In 1997, Nintendo was on the cutting edge in the video gaming industry. The Nintendo 64 proved that no mateer what a CD-ROM gaming system was able to do, a cartridged based gaming system could do better. That June, the case really proved the theory with the release of Starfox 64. The game was the very first to incorporate Nintendo's Rumple Pak, a force-feedback device that let's players feel each and every vibration at hand.In the game, you play Fox McCloud, a young determined fighter pilot who is sent on several missions to destroy Andross, a inane, mad genius that demands full control of the Lylat system. There are 15 remarkable stages that let you encounter in the entire game, alone over twenty-five different paths you decide on your way to Andross. The graphics are so realistic and full of promise, that you see the game so vividly, you feel like you're a part of it. In Starfox 64, you also have the use of 3 different vehicles, depending on your course, Arwing, Landmaster Tank, or the Blue Marine sub, only used in the Aquas sea level. The game also has a fierce battle level, for up to 4 players, where you shoot down your fellow squadron leaders, Peppy, Falco, and Slippy.It took nearly two years for other companies to develop the feel of the game, the exact same way Nintendo did with Starfox 64.

It never gets old to watch your VW bug shatter to pieces when it flips over or goes over a cliff. There are numerous passageways in the stages which manages to keep things fresh and entertaining.

Trains go by, warehouses operate and some freaky looking pumpkin things dance around. It offers much more to look at than, say, any Crusin' title. The control is superb, even the poor handling cars are a blast to play with.

       " 'Electronic Arts was one of a small group of third party developers that supported the N64 with a decent amount of games. One of them, Beetle Adventure Racing, was exclusive to the system and proved to be one of the best racing games to grace the Nintendo 64. Released in 1999, it was an arcade racer with the physics seen in serious racers but poked fun at itself all throughout the game.In BAR, you pick from a variety of Volkswagen Beetles and choose from one player mode(single and championship), two player mode(race only) and beetle battle mode (two to four players.) Select from one of six tracks (first one only available from the start.) and you\\'re off! There are tons of stuff to unlock and the only way to get everything is by playing through the championship mode and beating the four difficulty levels. As you pass each track, it becomes available in the other game modes. As you beat the game under each difficulty level, you unlock additional versions of Beetles. There are \"number\" boxes scattered throughout each track. They count as points and need to be collected to earn \"continues\" and depending on the difficulty level, you need a certain amount. You can earn up to 100 points; collect them all and you unlock a multi-player track for the Beetle Battle mode (only one track is available from the start) Lastly, there are \"flower\" boxes hidden throughout each track. Finding them unlocks cheats that you can turn on and off under the options screen.The PROS: There is so much content packed in this game, you get your money\\'s worth instantly. First off, the graphics, music, sound effects, controls and game play are impressive for a racing game on the N64. Then, there is the satisfaction on unlocking the bonus content for you and your friends to enjoy later. This game shows how to give players an incentive to play through the game entirely and have something to show for it. Each track is huge and there are multiple surprises and shortcuts that each lap promises you a different experience each time. The different versions of Beetles are pretty damn cool and its worth unlocking all of them. The Beetle Battle mode is fun to play with your friends and is a game within itself (the tracks are huge so getting 3 more players is the best way to go.)

The stages and vehicles you unlock in the game are actually pretty cool and have many unique designs to them. The racing never really feels tedious, and has the usual fun, arcade-style racing. It never gets old to watch your VW bug shatter to pieces when it flips over or goes over a cliff. There are numerous passageways in the stages which manages to keep things fresh and entertaining. Why a 7.25 rating? The music is the biggest draw and flaw of the game because it's very boring to listen to(So just listen to your own music when playing this game), and the controls feel a bit glitchy during certain segments of the game.

Trains go by, warehouses operate and some freaky looking pumpkin things dance around. It offers much more to look at than, say, any Crusin' title. The control is superb, even the poor handling cars are a blast to play with.

       " 'Electronic Arts was one of a small group of third party developers that supported the N64 with a decent amount of games. One of them, Beetle Adventure Racing, was exclusive to the system and proved to be one of the best racing games to grace the Nintendo 64. Released in 1999, it was an arcade racer with the physics seen in serious racers but poked fun at itself all throughout the game.In BAR, you pick from a variety of Volkswagen Beetles and choose from one player mode(single and championship), two player mode(race only) and beetle battle mode (two to four players.) Select from one of six tracks (first one only available from the start.) and you\\'re off! There are tons of stuff to unlock and the only way to get everything is by playing through the championship mode and beating the four difficulty levels. As you pass each track, it becomes available in the other game modes. As you beat the game under each difficulty level, you unlock additional versions of Beetles. There are \"number\" boxes scattered throughout each track. They count as points and need to be collected to earn \"continues\" and depending on the difficulty level, you need a certain amount. You can earn up to 100 points; collect them all and you unlock a multi-player track for the Beetle Battle mode (only one track is available from the start) Lastly, there are \"flower\" boxes hidden throughout each track. Finding them unlocks cheats that you can turn on and off under the options screen.The PROS: There is so much content packed in this game, you get your money\\'s worth instantly. First off, the graphics, music, sound effects, controls and game play are impressive for a racing game on the N64. Then, there is the satisfaction on unlocking the bonus content for you and your friends to enjoy later. This game shows how to give players an incentive to play through the game entirely and have something to show for it. Each track is huge and there are multiple surprises and shortcuts that each lap promises you a different experience each time. The different versions of Beetles are pretty damn cool and its worth unlocking all of them.

       " 'We probably all know about the hype that Pokemon (Pocket Monsters) has received about 7 years ago. It started off as a game that originated in Japan around 1995-1996, and it was introduced to the United States in 1998. A TV show and a trading card series followed. Plush Pikachu dolls were everywhere. I was a big fan of this fad, and I was only in the 5th grade (late 1999) when I purchased this game and strapped in for the time of my life.This is the \"blue version\" of the original Game Boy series. Just like in the Red Version, there are Pokemon that cannot be captured (Ekans, Magmar, Scyther, Growlith and Mankey just to name a few), and a trade cable will be required to fulfill \"catching them all\", but here\\'s a little lowdown and some advice to some starters of this game:You are given one out of three Pokemon to start out with (Bulbasaur, Charmander, Squirtle), and note that your first trainer is Brock, who uses the rock type. I recommend you choose Squirtle if you want to take it easy at first, because it learns Bubble at level 8. Bulbasaur is also a good choice, but it doesn\\'t learn Vine Whip until level 13. (I\\'m explaining the best moves to defeat Brock\\'s Pokemon.) Charmander is not a good bet, but good for a challenge. When you get to Pewter City, however, don\\'t rush to battle Brock until you feel like you are prepared. Metapod and Kakuna give out a lot of experience points so that leveling is easier, and if you catch a Caterpie/Metapod and raise it to a level 12 Butterfree, it can also help defeat Brock as well (with its Confusion skill).If you\\'re familiar with the later games of this series, you\\'ll realize a lot of differences. You can hold only 20 different types of items at a time (including PokeBalls and Key Items). And you gotta love the cheesy Pokemon graphics!Despite some flaws that haven\\'t been perfected until the later games of the series, this is still a classic game.And I\\'m not a big fan of RPG style games, but this is the easiest and less stressful of them in my opinion.

       " \"Let us be honest with ourselves. This is an old game. And yet it rocks most hard, say thankee. It's also highly addictive.The point of Pokemon is simple: catch cute, little, animated talking monsters with magic, plastic balls, and use them to kick the living daylights out of the cute talking monsters of your enemies. So in truth, it's a lot like real life.Plus, said monsters are fully changeable. You can give them a name, teach them special fighting skills, and even control how much they grow. This makes them much better than hamsters as pets go.Plus, its got ninjas! I'm not only talking about a ninja master who uses Pokemon to duel you (I guess he never learned how to use shuriken or swords or stuff), I also mean you can name you Pokemon things like: Mifune or Hayabusa or Zatoichi or Swordsman with an Umbrella (that probably won't fit). Of course, you can also name it Winky-dinky-do, if it do please ya. But I digress.Yes, Pokemon shows its age among modern video games. But so does Pong. And Pong is still mildly amusing. But without Pong, there'd be no Pokemom. And without Pokemon, there'd be no modern video gamage.

       " \"Pokemon was immensely popular in the late 1990s to early 2000s, and still has quite a fan base here in the new decade. Pokemon Blue, along with Red, was a remarkable feat that blended fun, as well as underlying lessons for many kids. As daunting as the task is, Ash Ketchum must show that he is the Pokemon master and the better of the two, when face to face with Gary Oak, his nemesis. During your journey, you'll encounter Gym masters, fun places to explore, new Pokemon, and much more. A truly fun and epic adventure.This game has many underlying lessons like:* Cities with different colors - many of which I didn't know existed - like lavender, saffron, and indigo.* Exploration - the idea of getting used to trying new things and ultimately carefully looking everywhere to find what needs to be found* Pokemon names - the many pokemon names were cleverly named to highlight its characteristics, like Mime, Diglett, Bulbasaur, Starmie, ditto, Drowzee, etc. My vocabulary expanded and I learned so much. The Pokemon alone are so immensely helpful in making words make sense.* Perseverance - when you lose the battle, it's simple: you just come back and try again until you achieve the mission or catch the Pokemon you want. It's immediately built into the psyche of the gamer. The game makes Ash Ketchum such a relateable and likeable character.The subtle educational aspect of this game is astounding and I'm very glad that I was one of the kids in my day playing Pokemon Blue.\",\n",

       " \"It has always been a habit for children to exhibit and swap their card/sticker/toy collections with their friends in school. The premise of Pokemon -to collect and train pokemon - was the perfect fertile growing field to exploit this fascination children had with collecting things. The first exploit was the TV show, where the characters in the videogame were rendered onto the TV screen. When that became popular enough, the creators rendered the full 150 Pokemon into thousands of different incarnations. Pokemon T-shirts, teddybears, actionfigures, trading cards, stickers, watches etc were all created under the slogan: 'you've gotta catch 'em all'... Parents had a rotten time, that's for sure. And it was this capitalistic, persistent, and continuous explotation of the pokemon name which made the name synonymous with childrens toys. The pokemon legacy was ruined by this exploitation, and the videgame was largely discredited as a childrens fad. But before the TV show, the toys, the trading cards, etc..the game stood pure and unspoilt by the impending pokemon-craze which was about to accompany it. Everybody loved the game. Pokemon was revered.In the game you play as Ash, whose one single ambition is to become the greatest Pokemon trainer in the world. To do so you must collect pokemon and train them in battle.  To catch Pokemon you need to engage in combat with wild Pokemon (wild animals). You choose which of your Pokemon is suitable for the fight and deminish the wild pokemon's strengh little by little untill it becomes weak enough to be captured. Once caught, the wild pokemon will become loyal and obedient. There's no 'set in stone' rule when it comes to catching Pokemon, if you fancy the look of a Pokemon, then you capture it.  Wild Pokemon are scattered throughout the game and you can catch them at any time.To complete the game, you must collect all eight gym badges. Gym badges are given to those who defeat gym owners. Gym owners are professional Pokemon trainers who are hardened by battle experience, and thus, much harder to defeat than normal Pokemon trainers. It takes a long time to collect the badges, because the gyms are sporodically spread throughout the game.  Between collecting badges and training Pokemon, you will encounter many RPG elements in the game, puzzles, dungeons, items, etc...  The game is huge and difficult and can take over 25 hours to complete. It certainly exceeds the expectations of a game merely designed to kill time on a long coach trip, which was what the GB was created for in the first place. Taking into account that the GB is a very primitive console, the kind of experience Pokemon offers exceeds all prior benchmarks in handheld gaming. It's an edifying experience.Not only is it the best GB game, it is one of the best overall games ever.\",\n",

I had the other two US Pokemon releases (Red and Yellow) and wanted to complete the trilogy again so I searched and found one adequately priced and bought it. (Luckily no problems with it.)Plot: Anyone who's played knows it, but for those of you who don't. The plot is simple, you, the protagonist embark on a quest to get all 8 gym badges, challenge the elite four, and become a Pokemon Master. Standard vague RPG story-line. I was able to grasp it when I was 7, so I assume it shouldn't be too hard to follow. If you manage to get lost you can find an online guide pretty easy now.Game-play:Game-play is simple turn based fighting. One person goes at a time. Pretty normal for an RPG. Players could do team fighters where a max of 6 Pokemon can be used a match, the first to K.O. all of their opponents Pokemon wins. During battle you can attack, switch Pokemon, or use items. (Run is a forth option if you're grinding away and training.)Graphics:Very out dated now, but was good when the game came out.Sound:Like the graphics out dated, but good for when the game came out.Overall:If you're a Pokemon collector or re-buying a copy like I did to replace a lost one you can't go wrong with it.\",\n",
       " 'This game started it all.  Maybe thats enough to convince you to buy it- the fact it is the first pokemon game, and you want to see what it was like.  If it is not- then please read on, and learn why to buy it.First off- this was the first ENGLISH pokemon game.  The original pokemon games were in Japan- pokemon green and pokemon red (not the us version).  They had different sprites for the pokemon, and they were pretty rough.  When they came over here, pokemon blue had already been released in Japan, which was a smoother revised version of the first 2.  Thats where the name blue came from.The graphics?  8 bit.  They arent amazing or anything like that- but its classic, like the first mario.  The graphics arent why you play.  Its fun and original.  Thats why you play it.  The Kanto story is basically a trainer who choses from bulbasaur, squirtle, or charmander and journeys around Kanto to become a pokemon master, and ends up stopping team rocket in the proccess.  After you beat the champion, you can try to catch the legendary pokemon Mewtwo and the legendary birds if you havnt already done so.  You can try to get Missingno, the infamous glitch pokemon- but theres not much to do.  As far as replay value goes, theres a large amount of it.  Different things can be done, and will greatly alter the outcome of the final battle.If you want a nice, pretty version of this game then go with fire red or leaf green, the remakes.  If you want a classic, then go with this.  Also, the music is better in this game than the remakes.',\n",

       " \"Pokemon Blue is a fabulous game with a very original plot, and two main objectives. It starts off with you, in your house, and you're ready to start your adventure with Pokemon, creatures that you catch and raise. You try to leave town, but Professor Oak (a Pokemon expert) stops you and brings you to his lab. There, he has you choose one of three Pokemon. This is a very important choice. I'll evaluate each one for you:BULBASAUR: A strong grass type Pokemon. The first two gym leaders are extremely vulnerable to his type, so he is undoubtedly a good choice. He also has a secondary type of poison, which can be a helpful feature. I highly recommend him if you are new to this game.SQUIRTLE: A very strong water Pokemon. He is very good against the first gym leader, but not the second. He is my personal choice. Squirtle is the moderate choice. He's for either for experienced players who don't want Charmander, beginner players who don't want Bulbasaur, or people who's skill is in between easy and experienced. Ice moves can also be taught to him, which can be an advantage.CHARMANDER: An exceptionally powerful fire Pokemon. He is not very good against the first gym leader, and terrible against the second. He seems to be the most popular choice, although he is the most difficult to train. He does become the best of the three in final form, because he obtains a secondary type of flying.From there, you must catch more Pokemon. You need a party of Pokemon (you can have up to 6) and you raise them, moving from town to town, gaining experience, fighting trainers, obtaining items, and catching new Pokemon. The other objective is to catch all the Pokemon (150 in Red &amp; Blue.) Some are easy to catch, some difficult, and some you must trade from Red. You see, the only diffrence between Red &amp; Blue is the distribution of Pokemon (11 diffrent in each version.) Some only in Red, some only in Blue. You must use a link cable between two versions. With the link cable, you can also battle the other person (but you won't gain experience.) That's a part of the game.I hope you found this helpful. Good luck on your game!\",\n",
       " 'It\\'s kind of strange how I manged to get into Pokemon, but here\\'s how it all began: One day, during a Science class, a friend of mine and I were going around our elementary school yard and picking up trash and Tootsie Roll wrappers. The actual goal was as many Tootsie Roll wrappers we each got, that was how many Tootsie Rolls we would get. Anyway, I found a stray Ponyta Pokemon Card in one part of the yard, and my friend found a Dark Charmeleon. My friend said, \"I\\'ll trade you my Dark Charmeleon for your Ponyta if you want\". Well, personally, I didn\\'t want to, I wanted to add this card and start a collection, but my friend\\'s Dark Charmeleon did look sort of cool at the time. I finally gave in and said, \"well, why not?\" So we traded. A few days later, we started acting out some of the episodes at recess (I\\'d never seen the episodes at the time). My friend was basically making up his own little stories... never mind the episodes that were on TV. Later on, my liking for Pokemon grew when my friend decided to bring his Game Boy Color to school, AND his Pokemon Red Version. I thought to myself, hmmm... this could be interesting. I asked him what he was playing and if I could watch him play it. he said, \"sure you can watch.\" I didn\\'t get to see much of the game because we weren\\'t outside for recess that long. Then, I decided I wanted to get my own version of Pokemon Red. I asked my mom and she said I could. So I did. I got the game (almost 7 years later and I still haven\\'t beaten it) and I ended up loving it. So, in conclusion, I\\'m eighteen and a half years old, a junior at Grafton High School, and I still love Pokemon (the games more than the episodes), but one thing has changed... my friend and I don\\'t do \"reenactments\" of our favorite episodes anymore like we used to.

This is both fun and time-consuming, which is great when you are at home sick or bored on a stormy day. Pok&eacute;mon are raised by winning battles and/or using Rare Candy. Raising Pok&eacute;mon may sound tedious, but you will change your mind about that when you actually play for yourself. Pok&eacute;mon is addictive from the moment you start your game all the way through. You will meet many new people on the way, become a hero, and win new items and abilities as you go along.As Ash, you travel through the world of Kanto, which is divided into a number of cities and towns. A map will be your guide as you make your way through the vast world of Pok&eacute;mon. Explore caves, oceans, tall grass, and rocky paths on your way. Each town or city usually has its own Pok&eacute;mon Gym, with a Gym Leader which is something like a Boss. Each time you beat a Gym Leader you receive a badge. You need eight badges to battle the Elite Four and the current Elite Four Champion. There are different diversions in each city and town, for example, Celadon City's department store and casino, and one of my personal favorites, Fuschia City's Safari Zone.Trainers can be found everywhere, good and bad, from Team Rocket invading the radio station, to the gyms, in the water, on the road, and pretty much anywhere you go. Random Pok&eacute;mon appear and battle you if you are in a cave, tall grass, or in the water. The wild Pok&eacute;mon you come across are the ones that you can catch if you have Pok&eacute;balls with you. Items such as the bike and repel can help prevent you from running into too many Pok&eacute;mon if you are trying to get somewhere. If your Pok&eacute;mon are tired or injured, you can stop at a Pok&eacute;mon center and heal them for free! You can also store Pok&eacute;mon via a computer terminal located within every Pok&eacute;mon Center.The music is so cute! And there is a lot of different music, so it doesn't get repetitive.If you are lucky enough to own Pok&eacute;mon Stadium, you can play Red or Blue on your TV screen using a Transfer Pak! You can also use the Pok&eacute;mon you raised on your Red or Blue game to battle in Pok&eacute;mon Stadium.Overall, this is one of the best games I have ever played. It is still fun after years of gameplay, as you never fully run out of stuff to do. If you want to get into Pok&eacute;mon, or if you're an old fan that never quite got around to getting the game, this is the game for you! Pok&eacute;maniacs rule!\",\n",
       " \"My kids and I all love the Pokemon Gameboys (the three of us each have our own Gameboy). The red Pokemon game is very similar to the blue, with the Yellow having some slight differences.I like the way the Pokemon game  challenges kids. I suggest also buying one of the books which shows the  various routes and places. This allows kids to work at the tasks without  getting frustrated.The idea is to start at Prof. Oak's house, get your  first Pokemon from him, and then journey all around the land of Pokemon,  collecting various wild pokemon (which you catch by battling them until  they faint), and doing battle with other trainers along the way.In the  process, kids learn to manuever through mazes of increasing complexity  (which is why the manuals are a help), to gather and use items, and to  develop strategies for fighting various types of Pokemon. My five year-old  even started to read while using her Gameboy, from needing to know which  items she had with her (in her Item List)!All in all these are great  games which can be played over and over (although only one game at a time  can be saved), and which will provide your kids with hundreds of hours of  fun.\",\n",
       " \"I have no idea why I still play Pokemon from time to time.  I was into it before it became popular, and I still enjoy the games (not the cards... ...) more than 2 years after the fad breathed it's last.  Yes, new titles have been coming out, but no one seems to like them very much and they are not changing the game enough to make them worth buying.Anyway, about the game.  You start out as a young boy living with your mother, and set out to become the world's greatest Pokemon trainer.  When you try to leave town, Professer Oak will give you a starter Pokemon (the only real difference between this one and Yellow is that in Yellow, you MUST start with Pikachu).  Once you have picked one, you must battle your rival, and then you can leave.  The rest is obvious...The main reason I still like this game is that it has amazing, Zelda-esque depth to it.  Many puzzles, and 15 element types of Pokemon.  Certain types are stronger against others, while each type has its weaknesses, too. There are a total of 150 Pokemon to be caught.  However, some only appear in the Red version and some only in Blue.  You must link to the Blue version to catch all 150!  (To make this easier, some people buy a Red AND Blue AND a Game Link Cable so they could complete the game on their own).Overall, this game is surprisingly fun and amusing, and has a great depth to it which will please many RPG (role-playing game) lovers.  Great game, so if you like RPGs or adventure games, get this one, if you don't already have it.\",\n",

       " \"The year was 1998.  I was twelve years old, in middle school, and the Pokemon games debuted in the United States for the very first time.  A game so simple and yet at the very same time: So complex.  Nothing was more addictive, nothing was more fun than playing Pokemon.  If you remember the craze (the REAL craze, presently it isn't nearly as strong as it was back then), then you remember what it was like to go to school back in those days.  Suddenly EVERYONE had a Gameboy.  Suddenly even those who didn't normally play games or even know what the hell a Gameboy was, had it.  And you'd go up to your friends and you'd trade Pokemon, you'd taunt each other about who was the better champion when you battled.  You got in arguments over who the best starter was.  Then you learned of those glitches to get all your Pokemon to level 100 by duplicating the Rare Candies.  You caught Missingno and M-Block and caught Safari Zone Pokemon by exploiting what may very well be one of the most widely known glitches in video game history.  And of course, you went to catch them all, and you probably had that ONE friend who you deemed your rival and you had to catch 'em all before he did.  If you remember all this, you're a true Pokemon fan.  This isn't a myth, this game debuted, sold gazillions of copies and started a craze that--while it isn't as strong--still exists today.  This was one of the heights of gaming period.The Red and Blue versions may have seen stateside release in 1998, but the game was actually made in 1995.  Before the television show came around.  When the TV series took off in America, the games came next and as I said, they sold more copies than the latest installment of Harry Potter.  I'm not kidding.Red and Blue began almost everything you currently see in the series today.  The game begins with you naming your character (you couldn't choose between a boy or a girl in this one) and then your rival.  Again, if you had Pokemon fever you probably named your main character Ash and your rival was named Gary (even the strategy guides referred to them as such).  It began with Professor Oak letting you have a Pokemon of your choice (between 3 starters) and then ultimately he'd send you on a journey with a Pokedex and have you document the Pokemon you'd find.  Along the way, you'd have to deal with Team Rocket, the bad guys who are always causing trouble and stealing everyone's Pokemon, as well as gather eight badges so you could challenge the Elite Four and become a Pokemon League Champion.  The entire formula began here, and just about everything mentioned above has been done in each and every main series Pokemon game hereafter.What was perhaps the strangest thing about Pokemon is that the game was surprisingly deep in terms of combat.  It was your traditional turn-based combat.  Simple, yet it was so complex.  For one, the game has a Rock/Paper/Scissors method to it.  Every Pokemon has a type, and every type has its own strengths and weaknesses.  For example, Water is strong up against fire but it is weak vs. Grass.  Grass is weak vs. fire etc. etc.  No Pokemon is invincible.  They all have a weakness to some type.  Though in these versions the psychics definitely have an unfair advantage as the type they're weak against (bug) is almost non-existent and there are hardly any bug type attacks.In the battle menu you're given a list of commands.  Fight, Item, PKMN, or Run.  You can switch Pokemon you've caught in and out of battle on the fly, but it'll usually cost you a turn.  It's the strategic portion of Pokemon that makes battling fun and addictive.  As you go through the game you'll be challenged by trainers and you never know what they'll throw at you!  It's completely unpredictable and some of them are tough.  It's also interesting because with 150 different Pokemon, the amount of teams you can make are endless, and it really makes you think about what types you want in your roster.  Because most of the Pokemon types are weak vs. more than just one type.  It's also important that you give them a variety of moves, as the moves are also typed.  On paper it doesn't seem like much, but when you actually play the game, you'll find a clog in your drain you didn't even know you had because you thought your team was perfect... but then that one Pokemon comes along and exposes your fatal flaw.Pokemon was no short game.  It was full of all sorts of side quests.  From the Safari Zone, to catching the Legendary Birds, to the Unknown Dungeon.  There was plenty to do, and even after the game was over there was STILL more to accomplish.  Of course, your main accomplishment was getting them all.  Pokemon could easily keep you busy for well over 60 hours.  In 1998 this is an amazing feat seeing as how most RPGs of TODAY don't keep you busy that long.  The main quest itself only took a measly 15 hours or so, but all the extra content kept you on your toes.Even more, Pokemon was one of the few Gameboy Games that made excellent use of the link cable.  Since Red and Blue versions had different Pokemon, some only appeared in certain versions.  You couldn't for example, catch a Magmar in the Red version, but you could in Blue.  How then, were Red players supposed to catch all 150?  By trading.  Until Pokemon came around, my link cable was collecting dust.  Trading was usually a slow grueling process, though.  Traded Pokemon also got an experience boost so they were easier to train.Even more exciting than trading, however, was what really made Pokemon a blast to play: Battling.  You and your friends could get together and battle one another!  Test out your Pokemon teams against your friends.  They were, more often not, far better to battle against than the games trainers.  It's always interesting to see who your opponents heavy hitter is.  With your friends it was always interesting.  Imagine how embarrassed you were to say a certain Pokemon sucked only to discover that the trainer actually did a good job training?As far as the game looks and sounds, it didn't really look all that great when it was released in 1998 (it was after all, a game made in 1995).  On the original gameboy it was pretty grainy (but very clear on the Gameboy Pocket) and of course it was black or white (unless you played it on a Super Gameboy or Gameboy Color).  For a Gameboy game, though, it actually wasn't too bad.  It was annoying to watch a Pokemon simply flinch to attack, and some of the animations weren't all that great, but it was to be expected due to the Gameboy's limitations.  The music, however, was fantastic.  The tunes were catchy--particularly the trainer battles and gym leader battles.  The only really annoying thing was the sound effects.  They weren't all that great, and its a shame that Nintendo actually continues to use those exact same sound effects in Pokemon games today.  Still, for what it's worth, this was the game you wanted on the Gameboy.Pokemon is a classic.  It'll always be a classic.  No matter who you are, if you played Pokemon ten years ago, the craze was completely undeniable.  If you got addicted like I did, chances are you're still playing today.  Because in its core, the game was far deeper than you thought it was, and the series continues to use that same basic formula even today.\",\n",

       " 'This is a great classic game.  You begin as a new Pokemon trainer, and soon select your first Pokemon.  The choices are Charmander, a fire type;squirtle, a water type;or bulbasaur, a fire type.  Interestingly, three Pokemon you choose from are like rock/paper/scissors, charmander beats bulbasaur, squirtle beats charmander, and bulbasaur beats squirtle.  Soon, you rival chooses his Pokemon(annoyingly, its always the one that has the type advantage, like if you choose squirtle he will choose charmander.  You are then given the task of completing a complete guide of Pokemon by catching all of them.  In order to beat the game, you only need the first 150 Pokemon, however, there is also a legendary number 151 Mew.  You catch Pokemon by using one you already have to weaken it, then catching it with a Pokeball.  Once you catch a Pokemon, you may use it to fight others, but you can only have up to 6 Pokemon at a time.  Along the way, you will encounter other trainers you may battle.  There are regular trainers, which you battle only for money, fun, and experience.  However, there are also gym leaders, which are specialized trainers with stronger Pokemon than regular trainers in their area have.  There are 8 in all, and once you beat them, you may then battle the elite four, who are much tougher than gym leaders and you have to fight all of them in succession.  You also encounter your rival throughout the game.  And he becomes Pokemon League Champion, however, once you defeat him, you become Pokemon League Champion.  There are also troublemaking team rocket members that you can and sometimes have to battle as well.  Their boss is also the leader of gym 8.  I have found the gym leaders and team rocket members are actually exceedingly easy if you know what you\\'re doing, however, the elite 4 is very tough, especially since you have to face them all toghether.  There are also legendary Pokemon, which are considered to be part of the 151 total, and they are very rewarding but challenging to catch.  Also, one cool thing is there is a lot of moves(although some are kind of stupid) and certain Pokemon have strengths over others.  For example, fire takes out grass easily.  However, you can beat the game just by having stronger Pokemon, however, this is actually harder than using strategy.  Because it takes a great length of time to level up, while a skilled player can quickly catch a Pokemon with a type advantage.  And to the guy who said he beat this game in a hour....if you think this game is easy, than you should quit playing videogames altoghether, because you obviously are such a great master of everything.  Also, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO BEAT THE GAME IN A HOUR!  AT MINIMUM, YOU HAVE TO PLAY IT FOR AT LEAST LIKE 20 HOURS FOR YOUR POKEMON TO BE HIGH ENOUGH LEVEL TOO!  Oh, wait, you must have used a gameshark.  Wow, no wonder you are so good at videogames.  But if anyone tells you they beat the game in a hour, they either cheated, found a big glitch, or both.  Or else their exaggerating.  But the only way the game could really beat that easy is if you had a strategy guide.  \"Oh this game is so easy, I only had to read 50 books on it to beat it on the first try.\"  GET REAL!  IF THIS ISN\\'T A CHALLENGE, NOTHING IS!  Overall, its a great game, but there are some annoying things.  First off, to get all 151, you must trade with freinds, as neither red nor blue has every Pokemon, but they do combined.  Most Pokemon are in both versions, but some are exclusive to either red or blue.  Also, as you level up your Pokemon, they evolve(which is really more accurately described as metamorphises), and some only evolve by trading them with the same Pokemon with another player.  Another thing is there is only one save slot. Finally, in the Japenese version, by getting the first 150, you get number 151,but in the US version you can only get them through Nintendo\\'s promotions or by cheating.  Hmm, giving Americans a raw deal, aye Nintendo?  You know we buy into your promotions instead of demanding that you make stuff available in the games.  In Japan, gamers would be outraged, but you know you can take advantage of us Americans?  Okay, go ahead.

It started off as a game that originated in Japan around 1995-1996, and it was introduced to the United States in 1998. A TV show and a trading card series followed. Plush Pikachu dolls were everywhere. I was a big fan of this fad, and I was only in the 5th grade (late 1999) when I purchased this game and strapped in for the time of my life.This is the \"blue version\" of the original Game Boy series. Just like in the Red Version, there are Pokemon that cannot be captured (Ekans, Magmar, Scyther, Growlith and Mankey just to name a few), and a trade cable will be required to fulfill \"catching them all\", but here\\'s a little lowdown and some advice to some starters of this game:You are given one out of three Pokemon to start out with (Bulbasaur, Charmander, Squirtle), and note that your first trainer is Brock, who uses the rock type. I recommend you choose Squirtle if you want to take it easy at first, because it learns Bubble at level 8. Bulbasaur is also a good choice, but it doesn\\'t learn Vine Whip until level 13. (I\\'m explaining the best moves to defeat Brock\\'s Pokemon.) Charmander is not a good bet, but good for a challenge. When you get to Pewter City, however, don\\'t rush to battle Brock until you feel like you are prepared. Metapod and Kakuna give out a lot of experience points so that leveling is easier, and if you catch a Caterpie/Metapod and raise it to a level 12 Butterfree, it can also help defeat Brock as well (with its Confusion skill).If you\\'re familiar with the later games of this series, you\\'ll realize a lot of differences. You can hold only 20 different types of items at a time (including PokeBalls and Key Items). And you gotta love the cheesy Pokemon graphics!Despite some flaws that haven\\'t been perfected until the later games of the series, this is still a classic game.And I\\'m not a big fan of RPG style games, but this is the easiest and less stressful of them in my opinion.

It's also highly addictive.The point of Pokemon is simple: catch cute, little, animated talking monsters with magic, plastic balls, and use them to kick the living daylights out of the cute talking monsters of your enemies. So in truth, it's a lot like real life.Plus, said monsters are fully changeable. You can give them a name, teach them special fighting skills, and even control how much they grow. This makes them much better than hamsters as pets go.Plus, its got ninjas! I'm not only talking about a ninja master who uses Pokemon to duel you (I guess he never learned how to use shuriken or swords or stuff), I also mean you can name you Pokemon things like: Mifune or Hayabusa or Zatoichi or Swordsman with an Umbrella (that probably won't fit). Of course, you can also name it Winky-dinky-do, if it do please ya. But I digress.Yes, Pokemon shows its age among modern video games. But so does Pong. And Pong is still mildly amusing.

As daunting as the task is, Ash Ketchum must show that he is the Pokemon master and the better of the two, when face to face with Gary Oak, his nemesis. During your journey, you'll encounter Gym masters, fun places to explore, new Pokemon, and much more. A truly fun and epic adventure.This game has many underlying lessons like:* Cities with different colors - many of which I didn't know existed - like lavender, saffron, and indigo.* Exploration - the idea of getting used to trying new things and ultimately carefully looking everywhere to find what needs to be found* Pokemon names - the many pokemon names were cleverly named to highlight its characteristics, like Mime, Diglett, Bulbasaur, Starmie, ditto, Drowzee, etc. My vocabulary expanded and I learned so much. The Pokemon alone are so immensely helpful in making words make sense.* Perseverance - when you lose the battle, it's simple: you just come back and try again until you achieve the mission or catch the Pokemon you want. It's immediately built into the psyche of the gamer. The game makes Ash Ketchum such a relateable and likeable character.The subtle educational aspect of this game is astounding and I'm very glad that I was one of the kids in my day playing Pokemon Blue.\",\n",
       " 'The original and best Pokemon game in the series in my opinion. Collect all of the original Pokemon to become a master!',\n",
       " \"It has always been a habit for children to exhibit and swap their card/sticker/toy collections with their friends in school. The premise of Pokemon -to collect and train pokemon - was the perfect fertile growing field to exploit this fascination children had with collecting things. The first exploit was the TV show, where the characters in the videogame were rendered onto the TV screen. When that became popular enough, the creators rendered the full 150 Pokemon into thousands of different incarnations. Pokemon T-shirts, teddybears, actionfigures, trading cards, stickers, watches etc were all created under the slogan: 'you've gotta catch 'em all'... Parents had a rotten time, that's for sure. And it was this capitalistic, persistent, and continuous explotation of the pokemon name which made the name synonymous with childrens toys. The pokemon legacy was ruined by this exploitation, and the videgame was largely discredited as a childrens fad. But before the TV show, the toys, the trading cards, etc..the game stood pure and unspoilt by the impending pokemon-craze which was about to accompany it. Everybody loved the game. Pokemon was revered.In the game you play as Ash, whose one single ambition is to become the greatest Pokemon trainer in the world. To do so you must collect pokemon and train them in battle.  To catch Pokemon you need to engage in combat with wild Pokemon (wild animals). You choose which of your Pokemon is suitable for the fight and deminish the wild pokemon's strengh little by little untill it becomes weak enough to be captured. Once caught, the wild pokemon will become loyal and obedient. There's no 'set in stone' rule when it comes to catching Pokemon, if you fancy the look of a Pokemon, then you capture it.  Wild Pokemon are scattered throughout the game and you can catch them at any time.To complete the game, you must collect all eight gym badges. Gym badges are given to those who defeat gym owners. Gym owners are professional Pokemon trainers who are hardened by battle experience, and thus, much harder to defeat than normal Pokemon trainers. It takes a long time to collect the badges, because the gyms are sporodically spread throughout the game.  Between collecting badges and training Pokemon, you will encounter many RPG elements in the game, puzzles, dungeons, items, etc...  The game is huge and difficult and can take over 25 hours to complete. It certainly exceeds the expectations of a game merely designed to kill time on a long coach trip, which was what the GB was created for in the first place. Taking into account that the GB is a very primitive console, the kind of experience Pokemon offers exceeds all prior benchmarks in handheld gaming. It's an edifying experience.Not only is it the best GB game, it is one of the best overall games ever.\",\n",
       " \"This type of RPG was easy to master, because at the start of the game, I chose Bulbasaur for this type of match. I used him in the first 2 stages of the game, but sometimes the rest of the game. Whenever you use a fire-type attack on an ice/water type, it will either say &quot;It's super effective&quot; or &quot;It's not very effective&quot; Otherwise, this game's a blast to play, with 150 different pokemon characters to choose from. Go buy them both. You'll need them to link up to Gold/Silver.\",\n",

This game doesn't really end. There's always something else to do. In this game you are a guy (in Crystal, they give you a choice! Then I actually can quit naming a guy a girl's name!) who catches, raises, and battles Pokemon, which are like animals. Pokemon Blue is a really fun game. Play Pokemon Blue. You'll be totally into Pokemon. I really highly recommend Pokemon Blue (and everything else Pokemon. Pokemon ROCKS!).\",\n",

       " \"Intro: I had Pokemon Blue ever since it was released but lost my copy ever since. I had the other two US Pokemon releases (Red and Yellow) and wanted to complete the trilogy again so I searched and found one adequately priced and bought it. (Luckily no problems with it.)Plot: Anyone who's played knows it, but for those of you who don't. The plot is simple, you, the protagonist embark on a quest to get all 8 gym badges, challenge the elite four, and become a Pokemon Master. Standard vague RPG story-line. I was able to grasp it when I was 7, so I assume it shouldn't be too hard to follow. If you manage to get lost you can find an online guide pretty easy now.Game-play:Game-play is simple turn based fighting. One person goes at a time. Pretty normal for an RPG. Players could do team fighters where a max of 6 Pokemon can be used a match, the first to K.O. all of their opponents Pokemon wins. During battle you can attack, switch Pokemon, or use items. (Run is a forth option if you're grinding away and training.)Graphics:Very out dated now, but was good when the game came out.Sound:Like the graphics out dated, but good for when the game came out.Overall:If you're a Pokemon collector or re-buying a copy like I did to replace a lost one you can't go wrong with it.\",\n",
       " 'This game started it all.  Maybe thats enough to convince you to buy it- the fact it is the first pokemon game, and you want to see what it was like.  If it is not- then please read on, and learn why to buy it.First off- this was the first ENGLISH pokemon game.  The original pokemon games were in Japan- pokemon green and pokemon red (not the us version).  They had different sprites for the pokemon, and they were pretty rough.  When they came over here, pokemon blue had already been released in Japan, which was a smoother revised version of the first 2.  Thats where the name blue came from.The graphics?  8 bit.  They arent amazing or anything like that- but its classic, like the first mario.  The graphics arent why you play.  Its fun and original.  Thats why you play it.  The Kanto story is basically a trainer who choses from bulbasaur, squirtle, or charmander and journeys around Kanto to become a pokemon master, and ends up stopping team rocket in the proccess.  After you beat the champion, you can try to catch the legendary pokemon Mewtwo and the legendary birds if you havnt already done so.  You can try to get Missingno, the infamous glitch pokemon- but theres not much to do.  As far as replay value goes, theres a large amount of it.  Different things can be done, and will greatly alter the outcome of the final battle.If you want a nice, pretty version of this game then go with fire red or leaf green, the remakes.  If you want a classic, then go with this.  Also, the music is better in this game than the remakes.',\n",
       " \"I first played this game when I was in 5th grade. I instantly fell in love with the simple, yet powerfully captivating quest. This, along with the N64 console and Age of Empires were the heart and soul of my 90's game experience. Pokemon may have evolved over the years, but this is well and truly where it all began.\",\n",

       " \"Pokemon Blue is a fabulous game with a very original plot, and two main objectives. It starts off with you, in your house, and you're ready to start your adventure with Pokemon, creatures that you catch and raise. You try to leave town, but Professor Oak (a Pokemon expert) stops you and brings you to his lab. There, he has you choose one of three Pokemon. This is a very important choice. I'll evaluate each one for you:BULBASAUR: A strong grass type Pokemon. The first two gym leaders are extremely vulnerable to his type, so he is undoubtedly a good choice. He also has a secondary type of poison, which can be a helpful feature. I highly recommend him if you are new to this game.SQUIRTLE: A very strong water Pokemon. He is very good against the first gym leader, but not the second. He is my personal choice. Squirtle is the moderate choice. He's for either for experienced players who don't want Charmander, beginner players who don't want Bulbasaur, or people who's skill is in between easy and experienced. Ice moves can also be taught to him, which can be an advantage.CHARMANDER: An exceptionally powerful fire Pokemon. He is not very good against the first gym leader, and terrible against the second. He seems to be the most popular choice, although he is the most difficult to train. He does become the best of the three in final form, because he obtains a secondary type of flying.From there, you must catch more Pokemon. You need a party of Pokemon (you can have up to 6) and you raise them, moving from town to town, gaining experience, fighting trainers, obtaining items, and catching new Pokemon. The other objective is to catch all the Pokemon (150 in Red &amp; Blue.) Some are easy to catch, some difficult, and some you must trade from Red. You see, the only diffrence between Red &amp; Blue is the distribution of Pokemon (11 diffrent in each version.) Some only in Red, some only in Blue. You must use a link cable between two versions. With the link cable, you can also battle the other person (but you won't gain experience.) That's a part of the game.I hope you found this helpful. Good luck on your game!\",\n",
       " 'It\\'s kind of strange how I manged to get into Pokemon, but here\\'s how it all began: One day, during a Science class, a friend of mine and I were going around our elementary school yard and picking up trash and Tootsie Roll wrappers. The actual goal was as many Tootsie Roll wrappers we each got, that was how many Tootsie Rolls we would get. Anyway, I found a stray Ponyta Pokemon Card in one part of the yard, and my friend found a Dark Charmeleon. My friend said, \"I\\'ll trade you my Dark Charmeleon for your Ponyta if you want\". Well, personally, I didn\\'t want to, I wanted to add this card and start a collection, but my friend\\'s Dark Charmeleon did look sort of cool at the time. I finally gave in and said, \"well, why not?\" So we traded. A few days later, we started acting out some of the episodes at recess (I\\'d never seen the episodes at the time). My friend was basically making up his own little stories... never mind the episodes that were on TV. Later on, my liking for Pokemon grew when my friend decided to bring his Game Boy Color to school, AND his Pokemon Red Version. I thought to myself, hmmm... this could be interesting. I asked him what he was playing and if I could watch him play it. he said, \"sure you can watch.\" I didn\\'t get to see much of the game because we weren\\'t outside for recess that long. Then, I decided I wanted to get my own version of Pokemon Red. I asked my mom and she said I could. So I did. I got the game (almost 7 years later and I still haven\\'t beaten it) and I ended up loving it. So, in conclusion, I\\'m eighteen and a half years old, a junior at Grafton High School, and I still love Pokemon (the games more than the episodes), but one thing has changed... my friend and I don\\'t do \"reenactments\" of our favorite episodes anymore like we used to. I really recommend this game.',\n",
       " \"One word: PLAYBACK. My sister first owned this game in 1998, and since then I have owned MANY Pok&eacute;mon games for both Game Boy Color and N64. And let me tell you, the original is always the best! Pok&eacute;mon Red and Blue are the best games ever created for Game Boy Color! I still love these games, trading Pok&eacute;mon, and battling other people with the Link Cable!First of all, people of any age can enjoy this game. It is cute and innocent enough to entertain children, but the strategy and the level of gameplay make it a worthwhile game for adults. Everyone will love this game.You start out as a trainer named Ash Ketchum from Pallet Town. Your mission is to become a Pok&eacute;mon Master by catching 150 Pok&eacute;mon (151 if you count Mew) and becoming the champion of the Elite Four. To do this, you must train and catch Pok&eacute;mon, raise them, and even trade them between Red and Blue versions using your Link Cable or the infrared port on your Game Boy Color. This is both fun and time-consuming, which is great when you are at home sick or bored on a stormy day. Pok&eacute;mon are raised by winning battles and/or using Rare Candy. Raising Pok&eacute;mon may sound tedious, but you will change your mind about that when you actually play for yourself. Pok&eacute;mon is addictive from the moment you start your game all the way through. You will meet many new people on the way, become a hero, and win new items and abilities as you go along.As Ash, you travel through the world of Kanto, which is divided into a number of cities and towns. A map will be your guide as you make your way through the vast world of Pok&eacute;mon. Explore caves, oceans, tall grass, and rocky paths on your way. Each town or city usually has its own Pok&eacute;mon Gym, with a Gym Leader which is something like a Boss. Each time you beat a Gym Leader you receive a badge. You need eight badges to battle the Elite Four and the current Elite Four Champion. There are different diversions in each city and town, for example, Celadon City's department store and casino, and one of my personal favorites, Fuschia City's Safari Zone.Trainers can be found everywhere, good and bad, from Team Rocket invading the radio station, to the gyms, in the water, on the road, and pretty much anywhere you go. Random Pok&eacute;mon appear and battle you if you are in a cave, tall grass, or in the water. The wild Pok&eacute;mon you come across are the ones that you can catch if you have Pok&eacute;balls with you. Items such as the bike and repel can help prevent you from running into too many Pok&eacute;mon if you are trying to get somewhere. If your Pok&eacute;mon are tired or injured, you can stop at a Pok&eacute;mon center and heal them for free! You can also store Pok&eacute;mon via a computer terminal located within every Pok&eacute;mon Center.The music is so cute! And there is a lot of different music, so it doesn't get repetitive.If you are lucky enough to own Pok&eacute;mon Stadium, you can play Red or Blue on your TV screen using a Transfer Pak! You can also use the Pok&eacute;mon you raised on your Red or Blue game to battle in Pok&eacute;mon Stadium.Overall, this is one of the best games I have ever played. It is still fun after years of gameplay, as you never fully run out of stuff to do. If you want to get into Pok&eacute;mon, or if you're an old fan that never quite got around to getting the game, this is the game for you! Pok&eacute;maniacs rule!\",\n",
       " \"My kids and I all love the Pokemon Gameboys (the three of us each have our own Gameboy). The red Pokemon game is very similar to the blue, with the Yellow having some slight differences.I like the way the Pokemon game  challenges kids. I suggest also buying one of the books which shows the  various routes and places. This allows kids to work at the tasks without  getting frustrated.The idea is to start at Prof. Oak's house, get your  first Pokemon from him, and then journey all around the land of Pokemon,  collecting various wild pokemon (which you catch by battling them until  they faint), and doing battle with other trainers along the way.In the  process, kids learn to manuever through mazes of increasing complexity  (which is why the manuals are a help), to gather and use items, and to  develop strategies for fighting various types of Pokemon. My five year-old  even started to read while using her Gameboy, from needing to know which  items she had with her (in her Item List)!All in all these are great  games which can be played over and over (although only one game at a time  can be saved), and which will provide your kids with hundreds of hours of  fun.\",\n",
       " \"I have no idea why I still play Pokemon from time to time.  I was into it before it became popular, and I still enjoy the games (not the cards... ...) more than 2 years after the fad breathed it's last.  Yes, new titles have been coming out, but no one seems to like them very much and they are not changing the game enough to make them worth buying.Anyway, about the game.  You start out as a young boy living with your mother, and set out to become the world's greatest Pokemon trainer.  When you try to leave town, Professer Oak will give you a starter Pokemon (the only real difference between this one and Yellow is that in Yellow, you MUST start with Pikachu).  Once you have picked one, you must battle your rival, and then you can leave.  The rest is obvious...The main reason I still like this game is that it has amazing, Zelda-esque depth to it.  Many puzzles, and 15 element types of Pokemon.  Certain types are stronger against others, while each type has its weaknesses, too. There are a total of 150 Pokemon to be caught.  However, some only appear in the Red version and some only in Blue.  You must link to the Blue version to catch all 150!  (To make this easier, some people buy a Red AND Blue AND a Game Link Cable so they could complete the game on their own).Overall, this game is surprisingly fun and amusing, and has a great depth to it which will please many RPG (role-playing game) lovers.  Great game, so if you like RPGs or adventure games, get this one, if you don't already have it.\",\n",

From the perspective of a  hard-core, long-time gamer it's heartening to know that something as  popular as this does not require a monster PC with a Voodoo5 (indeed, it  could easily be converted for the Commodore 64), and the never-ending,  open-ended gameplay is a nice homage to 'Elite'. The necessity to buy two  copies of the game to 'complete' it, and the massive marketing blitz  surrounding the core product is somewhat jading, but don't let that detract  from the essential purity of the original.\",\n",

       " \"The year was 1998.  I was twelve years old, in middle school, and the Pokemon games debuted in the United States for the very first time.  A game so simple and yet at the very same time: So complex.  Nothing was more addictive, nothing was more fun than playing Pokemon.  If you remember the craze (the REAL craze, presently it isn't nearly as strong as it was back then), then you remember what it was like to go to school back in those days.  Suddenly EVERYONE had a Gameboy.  Suddenly even those who didn't normally play games or even know what the hell a Gameboy was, had it.  And you'd go up to your friends and you'd trade Pokemon, you'd taunt each other about who was the better champion when you battled.  You got in arguments over who the best starter was.  Then you learned of those glitches to get all your Pokemon to level 100 by duplicating the Rare Candies.  You caught Missingno and M-Block and caught Safari Zone Pokemon by exploiting what may very well be one of the most widely known glitches in video game history.  And of course, you went to catch them all, and you probably had that ONE friend who you deemed your rival and you had to catch 'em all before he did.  If you remember all this, you're a true Pokemon fan.  This isn't a myth, this game debuted, sold gazillions of copies and started a craze that--while it isn't as strong--still exists today.  This was one of the heights of gaming period.The Red and Blue versions may have seen stateside release in 1998, but the game was actually made in 1995.  Before the television show came around.  When the TV series took off in America, the games came next and as I said, they sold more copies than the latest installment of Harry Potter.  I'm not kidding.Red and Blue began almost everything you currently see in the series today.  The game begins with you naming your character (you couldn't choose between a boy or a girl in this one) and then your rival.  Again, if you had Pokemon fever you probably named your main character Ash and your rival was named Gary (even the strategy guides referred to them as such).  It began with Professor Oak letting you have a Pokemon of your choice (between 3 starters) and then ultimately he'd send you on a journey with a Pokedex and have you document the Pokemon you'd find.  Along the way, you'd have to deal with Team Rocket, the bad guys who are always causing trouble and stealing everyone's Pokemon, as well as gather eight badges so you could challenge the Elite Four and become a Pokemon League Champion.  The entire formula began here, and just about everything mentioned above has been done in each and every main series Pokemon game hereafter.What was perhaps the strangest thing about Pokemon is that the game was surprisingly deep in terms of combat.  It was your traditional turn-based combat.  Simple, yet it was so complex.  For one, the game has a Rock/Paper/Scissors method to it.  Every Pokemon has a type, and every type has its own strengths and weaknesses.  For example, Water is strong up against fire but it is weak vs. Grass.  Grass is weak vs. fire etc. etc.  No Pokemon is invincible.  They all have a weakness to some type.  Though in these versions the psychics definitely have an unfair advantage as the type they're weak against (bug) is almost non-existent and there are hardly any bug type attacks.In the battle menu you're given a list of commands.  Fight, Item, PKMN, or Run.  You can switch Pokemon you've caught in and out of battle on the fly, but it'll usually cost you a turn.  It's the strategic portion of Pokemon that makes battling fun and addictive.  As you go through the game you'll be challenged by trainers and you never know what they'll throw at you!  It's completely unpredictable and some of them are tough.  It's also interesting because with 150 different Pokemon, the amount of teams you can make are endless, and it really makes you think about what types you want in your roster.  Because most of the Pokemon types are weak vs. more than just one type.  It's also important that you give them a variety of moves, as the moves are also typed.  On paper it doesn't seem like much, but when you actually play the game, you'll find a clog in your drain you didn't even know you had because you thought your team was perfect... but then that one Pokemon comes along and exposes your fatal flaw.Pokemon was no short game.  It was full of all sorts of side quests.  From the Safari Zone, to catching the Legendary Birds, to the Unknown Dungeon.  There was plenty to do, and even after the game was over there was STILL more to accomplish.  Of course, your main accomplishment was getting them all.  Pokemon could easily keep you busy for well over 60 hours.  In 1998 this is an amazing feat seeing as how most RPGs of TODAY don't keep you busy that long.  The main quest itself only took a measly 15 hours or so, but all the extra content kept you on your toes.Even more, Pokemon was one of the few Gameboy Games that made excellent use of the link cable.  Since Red and Blue versions had different Pokemon, some only appeared in certain versions.  You couldn't for example, catch a Magmar in the Red version, but you could in Blue.  How then, were Red players supposed to catch all 150?  By trading.  Until Pokemon came around, my link cable was collecting dust.  Trading was usually a slow grueling process, though.  Traded Pokemon also got an experience boost so they were easier to train.Even more exciting than trading, however, was what really made Pokemon a blast to play: Battling.  You and your friends could get together and battle one another!  Test out your Pokemon teams against your friends.  They were, more often not, far better to battle against than the games trainers.  It's always interesting to see who your opponents heavy hitter is.  With your friends it was always interesting.  Imagine how embarrassed you were to say a certain Pokemon sucked only to discover that the trainer actually did a good job training?As far as the game looks and sounds, it didn't really look all that great when it was released in 1998 (it was after all, a game made in 1995).  On the original gameboy it was pretty grainy (but very clear on the Gameboy Pocket) and of course it was black or white (unless you played it on a Super Gameboy or Gameboy Color).  For a Gameboy game, though, it actually wasn't too bad.  It was annoying to watch a Pokemon simply flinch to attack, and some of the animations weren't all that great, but it was to be expected due to the Gameboy's limitations.  The music, however, was fantastic.  The tunes were catchy--particularly the trainer battles and gym leader battles.  The only really annoying thing was the sound effects.  They weren't all that great, and its a shame that Nintendo actually continues to use those exact same sound effects in Pokemon games today.  Still, for what it's worth, this was the game you wanted on the Gameboy.Pokemon is a classic.  It'll always be a classic.  No matter who you are, if you played Pokemon ten years ago, the craze was completely undeniable.  If you got addicted like I did, chances are you're still playing today.  Because in its core, the game was far deeper than you thought it was, and the series continues to use that same basic formula even today.\",\n",

       " 'Pokemon Blue is amazing. It isn\\'t as good as some of the recent Pokemon games, but its still a wonderful game. Not so heavy on plot, your main objective is to catch all 150 of the Pokemon to complete your Pokedex and to stop Team Rocket. Catching Pokemon is not as easy as it sounds. They will fight hard and almost always break the Pokeballs you try to catch them in. It gets addicting after a while though, and soon your team is filled with interesting creatures. It is almost like training a pet, you can teach them special moves to defeat your opponents, and if you use them a lot they will \"evolve\".Graphics: C-, the Pokemon aren\\'t near as cute or detailed as they are in future versions. The black/white display isn\\'t so fun either.Sound: D, I have never heard worse scores in my life. It is repetitive, dull, and will give a headache in less then 2 minutes.Storyline: B, Nice and short. I couldn\\'t ask for anything better.Fun: A, Even with minor repetition I still find the game to be a blast.Overall, the game is %100 a classic. Buy it or you will never be a true gamer.',\n",
       " \"By now every man, woman andchild has heard of pokemon, and it's reputation.  The cute little animals you catch in a ball and then force to fight eachother has captured the hearts of kids in America, and the wallets of parents.  Many people hate this game with out even giving it a try.  Why is that, the overly priced, merchandice, the barbaric card game (banned in many elementary schools and pre schools nation wide) and terrible TV show and average movies...  When looking at all the [stuff] it's easy to forget the concept, and enjoyment of the game itself.The game is an RPG, meaning experience building and random battles, all in a quest (in this case) to become the best.  You have a rival (who you name) and the two of you compete through out the entire game.because this is on Gameboy (before Color) the graphics are dull, plain, boring.  However after getting past that you have a very deep, very fun, and very addicting game.  Catching 151 of the creatures (151 through either gameshark or Pokemon Conventions) and in these cases it is a little difficult to put the game down.Overall the game is worth playing because it is a lot of fun, forget the [stuff] that it spawned and play the first game, if you are an RPG Fan you will not be disapointed.\",\n",
       " 'This is a great classic game.  You begin as a new Pokemon trainer, and soon select your first Pokemon.  The choices are Charmander, a fire type;squirtle, a water type;or bulbasaur, a fire type.  Interestingly, three Pokemon you choose from are like rock/paper/scissors, charmander beats bulbasaur, squirtle beats charmander, and bulbasaur beats squirtle.  Soon, you rival chooses his Pokemon(annoyingly, its always the one that has the type advantage, like if you choose squirtle he will choose charmander.  You are then given the task of completing a complete guide of Pokemon by catching all of them.  In order to beat the game, you only need the first 150 Pokemon, however, there is also a legendary number 151 Mew.  You catch Pokemon by using one you already have to weaken it, then catching it with a Pokeball.  Once you catch a Pokemon, you may use it to fight others, but you can only have up to 6 Pokemon at a time.  Along the way, you will encounter other trainers you may battle.  There are regular trainers, which you battle only for money, fun, and experience.  However, there are also gym leaders, which are specialized trainers with stronger Pokemon than regular trainers in their area have.  There are 8 in all, and once you beat them, you may then battle the elite four, who are much tougher than gym leaders and you have to fight all of them in succession.  You also encounter your rival throughout the game.  And he becomes Pokemon League Champion, however, once you defeat him, you become Pokemon League Champion.  There are also troublemaking team rocket members that you can and sometimes have to battle as well.  Their boss is also the leader of gym 8.  I have found the gym leaders and team rocket members are actually exceedingly easy if you know what you\\'re doing, however, the elite 4 is very tough, especially since you have to face them all toghether.  There are also legendary Pokemon, which are considered to be part of the 151 total, and they are very rewarding but challenging to catch.  Also, one cool thing is there is a lot of moves(although some are kind of stupid) and certain Pokemon have strengths over others.  For example, fire takes out grass easily.  However, you can beat the game just by having stronger Pokemon, however, this is actually harder than using strategy.  Because it takes a great length of time to level up, while a skilled player can quickly catch a Pokemon with a type advantage.  And to the guy who said he beat this game in a hour....if you think this game is easy, than you should quit playing videogames altoghether, because you obviously are such a great master of everything.  Also, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO BEAT THE GAME IN A HOUR!  AT MINIMUM, YOU HAVE TO PLAY IT FOR AT LEAST LIKE 20 HOURS FOR YOUR POKEMON TO BE HIGH ENOUGH LEVEL TOO!  Oh, wait, you must have used a gameshark.  Wow, no wonder you are so good at videogames.  But if anyone tells you they beat the game in a hour, they either cheated, found a big glitch, or both.  Or else their exaggerating.  But the only way the game could really beat that easy is if you had a strategy guide.  \"Oh this game is so easy, I only had to read 50 books on it to beat it on the first try.\"  GET REAL!  IF THIS ISN\\'T A CHALLENGE, NOTHING IS!  Overall, its a great game, but there are some annoying things.  First off, to get all 151, you must trade with freinds, as neither red nor blue has every Pokemon, but they do combined.  Most Pokemon are in both versions, but some are exclusive to either red or blue.  Also, as you level up your Pokemon, they evolve(which is really more accurately described as metamorphises), and some only evolve by trading them with the same Pokemon with another player.  Another thing is there is only one save slot. Finally, in the Japenese version, by getting the first 150, you get number 151,but in the US version you can only get them through Nintendo\\'s promotions or by cheating.  Hmm, giving Americans a raw deal, aye Nintendo?  You know we buy into your promotions instead of demanding that you make stuff available in the games.  In Japan, gamers would be outraged, but you know you can take advantage of us Americans?  Okay, go ahead.  But despite the fact that it isn\\'t as good as the Japenese version or a perfect game, Pokemon Red is still one of my favorites.',\n",

Jigglypuff and Ness are not for beginners, but Metronome might be the strongest move in the game.

       " \"I bought a used version of this cartridge after seeing my 3-year old son being hooked with it during a visit to my sister's.You have 8 characters to choose from with 4 additional hidden characters you can release after succeeding in various playing modes at specific difficulty levels.  Each character has its own set of special moves, sounds and taunts.The purpose of the game is to use your character skills and moves to knock off your opponent from the hovering playing field.  Damage to you or to your opponent builds up as you hit him/her.  Some punches or moves give more damage than others and as the damaged builds up, the character turns more vulnerable to being knocked off.There are a few moves that only give damage and other moves are used to specifically knock off your opponent.  This means that you cannot just push buttons at random, it requires a lot of patience and some reflexes to defeat your adversary consistently.The game is extremely simple to learn, yet there are quite a large amount of special moves to master.  You will definitely require all those special moves when playing the most advanced levels or when facing more skilled human opponents.I kind of sticked with Mario when playing, for me it is the most well-rounded character, although I'm sure  that some of the hidden characters are quite versatile as well.I found out that this game can be handicap adjusted, making it fun and fair for all ages and skill levels.This game is definitely more fun in a multi-player scenario, but it is also extremely fun using the computer as an opponent.  You can play a free-for-all match (everyone against everyone) with up to 3 computer (or human) controlled characters, having each one the same or their own unique skill levels.  There is also a Team-Battle, where you team up with a computer or a human to face another human/computer team.One small thing I did noticed was some slow control response in some instances, especially when playing the harder levels; it requires a little patience getting used to it.This game is very easy to learn, extremely addictive, colorful, fun, challenging and funny.  It has dozens of playing options and many cool sounds. It is quite entertaining with lots of clean fun for the whole family.5 stars and 100% recommended.\",\n",

       " 'This has to be one of the best games I have ever played. The whole concept of nintendo characters pounding other nintendo characters into oblivion is interesting, and very fun. The Comical and Chaotic feeling of running around and bashing other players of the field in multyplayer fun. You play as one of twelve characters; four of which must be unlocked.  The basic characters are all easy to play with, and relatively popular. They are as follows: Kirby (Kirby), Mario (Mario), Link (Zelda), Samus Aran (Super Metroid), Donkey Kong (Donkey Kong), Fox McCloud (Star Fox), Pikachu (Pokemon), Yoshi (Mario). Most of these should be familiar to the moderate gamer, with the exception of Samus, a popular GB character with Metroid.  There are many items in this game that you can collect to boost progress. You can get a light saber type thing, making an adequate weapon for plasy. You can also get a fire flower (Mario Bros), Pokeball (Pokemon), and ray gun (star fox). You can also get a Star Man, making you invincible, and a hammer, letting you smash other opponents out of the match.The damage and knock out works like this: With each attack landed on an opponent, their damage percentage goes up. The higher the percentage, the farther and faster each player will fly after each hit. Players can fall off the edge of the map, or fly too high and fall into the horizon.  In single player mode, you fight computer controlled characters on many different stages. You earn points based on how well you do (ie how fast you defeat all the enemies) and what you do (ie using the same move the whole stage). Eventually you can fight the master hand, boss of the last stage. Once you beat him, you have the opportinity to unlock hidden characters, Luigi (Mario), Jigglypuff(Pokemon), Ness(EarthBound), and Captain Falcon(FZero Racing). You also try for the highest score.Multiplayer can be more fun. You basically go through a skirmish against 1 to 3 other players, whether controlled by the computer or a human. The items will apply, and you can turn them on or off by playing 50 multiplayer games and unlocking the item switch. After you end the time limit with more points than all other players / if everyone else is out of lives, you get ranked 1st 2nd 3rd or 4th, and the stats of the game are sent into the game stats bank, which you can look over.You can also practice some of the stages of the game, trying for the best time. If you persist in this, you can unlock luigi. It is always good to get practice.Overall, this game deserves a more than five stars. It is very fun, and it provides endless entertainment.',\n",

Also, items fall down from the sky that you can use againts your opponents. Pokeballs, (which actually contain several random pokemon that each do different things) swords, hammers, Maximum Tomatoes and fire-flowers all rain down so you can reign over everyone on the field.

If you own a GameCube look for Super Smash Bros Melee.\",\n",
       " \"Super Smash Brothers... I remember reading in a magazine about this game and thinking, &quot;Finally a game that's going to be a smash!&quot;. A year or so later when I played it for the first time, my hopes were confirmed. This title is one if the best, if not the best, fighting and party game for the N64. Not being much of a Mortal Kombat fan, because of the blood and gore, I was happy to finally see a game that was fun, innovating and bloodless. No, no finishing moves in this game. :-)Super Smash brothers is exactly what the name says, a smash. With 8 available Nintendo stars to choose from at first and 4 hidden away to be unlocked later, this game is a major intrest-getter. Great Nintendo stars are avalaible to fight with such as Pikachu, Link, Kirby, Donkey Kong,etc. and keep the game fun and exciting. There is a hidden level to unlock and secret options to uncover, guaranteeing that you won't want to put the game down till you have them all.As a fun factor and replay value this game definitley rates way over a five. The game supports up to 4-players at once, making it a great party game. All you need is some popcorn, a couple of sodas and a few pillows and the night is made. You can play with computer controlled characters and also as teams, up to three diferent teams at once. The one player game is very fun and challenging too.  SSB contains no blood or gore making it a great title for anyone. Parents will be happy about that matter because I know how some parents don't apreciate blood, gore and guts in a game.The gameplay rates very high also.Gameplay is easy to learn, fast and furious. The action keeps you on your toes and you fingers twitching at the controls.  The levels and graphics are smooth and cool. Sometimes during a 4-player match the game will go into slow-motion for a couple of seconds. Some gamers see this as a problem but I think sometimes it adds to the effect of the game. Also some elements or weapons are in 2-d making thme seem like paper but this does not detract from the game at all. Some levels are cute, like the Yoshi level and the Kirby one, while others have a sort of seriousness to them, Fox's and Link are examples. All the levels have some sort of hazard to them like a plane coming and shooting lasers at you or  a tree blowing you off the screen, adding to the fun and challenge rate. But no matter what level you play on the graphics a clean,very crisp and the levels are very fun.This title is really great for a bunch of friends or just for yourself and is definitley a game that even parents can learn to play. So that makes it in a way a great way to spend time with your kids too. For the kids, this is a great title for new or experienced gamers. This game is worth every penny of what you spend on it.A party bash, a rainy day, you shouldn't stall , it's great for all. :-)  From an owner and gamer, Andrew H. King.\",\n",
       " \"If you own the N64 then you must have this game. The graphics are a bit out dated, but who cares! The game is still great! Even though there are less characters than the newer smash bros this game still brings in the punches. You can play story/one player mode and also play up to 4 people.In one player mode you can either do the story mode or do the challenges. Both are fun! You can set up the difficulties and also set up how many lives you can use.Multiplayer mode is also fun. You have the ability to play in teams or not. Still you can set up the difficulties. PLUS, you can have a time battle or set up how many lives you can use.Though unlike mele you can't plat story mode with 2 players... but that shouldn't be the reason for not getting this game!\",\n",
       " 'This game was fantastic when it came out.  As a kid nothing made me more excited than seeing all of my Nintendo characters in one game fighting it out.  This game shined the most multiplayer where you could play against 3 other people. The only problem with getting this game now is that there are sequels out there that are far superior to this one with even more characters.  If your feeling nostalgic, then get this game.',\n",
       " \"This Game is Awsome...purely...AWSOME!!!! I has an OK 1 player made but... the multiplayer is just outstanding!! This is a great party game... You just can't stop playing. Personally, DK, Fox, Kirby are my Favorites...btw...if you set the damage in multiplayer to 200%, then hit players 1-3 times using DK's ^+B spcieal move, your opponent will FLY!!! AND I MEAN FLY!!! ;) My Friends hate this move!!! :) Also Fox's \\\\/+B Special move, you can reflect all moves and attacks!!! and Kirby can suck players abilities and fall on them with his \\\\/+B special move like a brick!!! You have to buy this game!! It is the best ever!!\",\n",

Its really great, in adventure you get to fight lots of assorted people, and in vs, you get to pick your character to fight against an opponent.  I played it with my brother for about 1000 vs mode matches, and now I'm bored with it.  It lasts, but once you unlock all the secrets, and play vs a lot, it does get boring.\",\n",
       " \"This game is excellent. You can fight all of your favorite Nintendo characters together and have a good time. There is no blood, gore or cursing in the game, and that is what separates this game for all other fighting games. (One reason I don't buy a lot of fighting games is the blood and gore.) I think everyone will have a good time except those people that think games are only good when there is blood and gore. (Read some of the other reviews and you'll see what I mean.) There are so many good things about this game that 1000 words isn't enough. I will tell you the cons instead of wasting time and words. CONS: Hard to get secret characters, Not enough Pokemon Characters, More Characters Should Be In It such as: Turok, Princess Peach, Zelda, Wario, Bowser, Diddy Kong, Dixie Kong, Charmander, Mewtwo, Bomberman, Goemon, Yae, Ebisumaru, Sasuke, Impact, James Bond, and others. Better weapons are needed because some of them are lame (The fan and Shells for example)Other than that, the game is great, and you definitely should buy it!\",\n",

       " \"super smash bros is an incredible game. the graphics are nice and simple the controls are great. this game may not be the best n64 game but it's definitly in the top 10. you can chose all your favorite nintendo characters and they all have unique moves. you start of with 8 characters but when you accomplish certain things you get new characters like luigi and captain falcon. super smash bros appeals to any age(i'm 14 and this is one of my favorite games).there are a good selection of stages with a lot of variety.The object of the game is not to kill the other person but to knok him of the stage far enouph that he won't be able to jump back to the stage.the game has 5 dificulty levels: very easy, easy, normal, hard and very hard. which makes the game more chalenging as you get better.there are also 24 mimi games or bonus stages you can play without having to play a i player game. each character has 2 different bonus stages.the part where the game really eccels is the multi player mode which is so incredibly fun. there is no game that equls super smash brothers as a multiplayer game.overall this is a great game and a must in every n64 game librarie\",\n",
       " \"This game is the one my kids play more than any other on their Nintendo. They have other games, they rent other games, but they keep coming back to this one.They like the two player option. They like the challenge  (they're not teens yet). They like the many characters that can be chosen  from different games. They like being able to set their and the opponent's  skill levels. They just love this game!I personally wish it were a  little less violent, but compared to other games out there, this is a  teaparty. So if you're a parent looking for a fun game that will give your  kids hundreds of hours of play and one they won't get tired of, buy this  game.\",\n",

       " \"This is a great game, one of the best for the system. It's certainly innovative when it comes to fighting games. There's no button mashing or crazy combos in this game, just simple B, A and control stick combos. In a way this is good; its not as complicated, and easy to get started. But it's also bad; there's a limited number of moves.Also, some characters are really useless. Jigglypuff? One Pokemon was enough, but this is even a crapified version of Kirby. Which takes me to number two. Kirby. I like the character an the developers had teh right idea, but hes too strong. Playing against aKirby gets really cheap...I'm sure some of you know what I mean. His brick can protect him from about anything!There's only 9 stages...a few of which are really bad like Kirby's, and the Pokemon one's not too great either. But there's good ones also like Hyrule, Fox, Mario and the Donkey. Then there's the nostalgic ones.This game is great, especially because of its small learning curve and awesome replay value(the best next to goldeneye). Definitely worth your money.\",\n",

With easy gameplay, good BGM, endless multiplayer battle, great feedback when using Rumble pak, some characters info (obviously not as much as on the GC or Wii), tons of fun, and also that this game left the necessary for its successors; SSB is worthy to own. If you still don\\'t have this \"jewel\", hurry up and find it! You 64 owners should have it! Consider four good-working controllers and rumble paks.But the only bad thing.

The only bad thing about the game is that there r only 12 charecters and not that many stages but remember this is the first one.

Kirby (my favorite) Yoshi (my other favorite) zelda, samus, mario, DK, pikachu, and fox. it is the best game I own. each person has different powers. but all of them have  B attack, up B attack,  down B attack, A attack, smash attacks, a block, a throw attack oh and punches and kicks and a bunch of other combos. and all of them are different. well luigi's and mario's are sort of a like. and lots of battle arenas. and you can copy some ones B attack if you are kirby. my favorite person to play with is kirby he may be a little cute pink cuddly puff ball (...) oh and I like yoshi at first I hated yoshi but then I used him and he was prety darn good. my little brother likes samus. I like every body but my favorites are yoshi and Kirby. and if you think this looks like a little kid game you are wrong. it is packed with punches and kicks. oh and I want a game cube because they have super smash brothers melee but it is to much $$$. oh and super smash bros melee has a bunch of new people to choose and different battle arenas and a lot better graphics. and lots of new stuff. so you had better buy this game. it is the best game vever!. it is one big smash!  trust me you are going to like it. so get out there and buy this super awsom (...) game. it rocks!!!\",\n",

There are also a variety of levels, each containing their own special dangers. The object of the game is to knock your opponent off the edge of the thing you are fighting on. It could range from a spaceship in the star-e-ness of space to the tops of skyscrapers!Each fighter has their own special moves and abilities to crush other fighters with. Their moves are not hard to learn, so you can get pretty good at the game in a relitively short time.Also, Super Smash Bros. doesn't get boring after you beat it.

       " \"Super Smash Brothers was one of the last installments to the now dead N64 gaming line. A perfect ending, if you ask me. This is't your average Mortal Kombat or Tekken game. You don't have limited health, you aren't crammed up in a tiny little space, and the computer player dosen't always win. You can run around on vast terrains, where items such as light sabers (Samus Aron or Star Fox, I don't know), pokeballs (Pokemon), hammers(The original Donkey Kong arcade), and lasers (Star Fox) fall from the sky, and are at whoever grabs them first's disposal. The levels are:Mario Brother's flying island thingie, Zelda's castle, Saffaron City, Star Fox's ship, Samus Aaron's near-destructed planet, Donkey Kong's jungle, Yosie's island, and Kirby's planet. There's also a hidden level, The Mario Brother's classic arcade world. And, now, the players:Mario, Yoshi, Kirby, Star Fox, Samus Aron, Donkey Kong, Link, and...Pikachu. And, there a 4 bonus characters, and I'll tell ya how to get them:Jigglypuff-All you have to do is beat the game, on any mode, no matter how many lives you lose.Captain Falcon-Beat the whole game on any challenge level in under 20 minutes.Ness-Beat the game on normal with only 3 lives, without getting any game overs.Luigi-Go to pratice and beat everyone's (except the bonus character's) bonus game 1. Luigi is faster and stronger than Mario.HAVE FUN!!\",\n",
       " \"I convinced my cousin to rent this game back when it first came out because we were crazy about pokemon and I loved the commercial for it.When we first played it, it was hard. The controls were hard and there were too many moves to remember. But once you get around the learning curve, which only took a day or 2, the game is a great ride.The thing about the game is that it has everybody's favorite Nintendo characters in one game. It doesn't even skip on the moves. You can throw Link's boomerang, Samus Aran's morphing ball bombs, Mario's fireballs, Jigglypuff's sing, and many other characters moves. The graphics for the game were excellent at the time and still look better than any N64 game except Mario 64.Not only do you have every characters special moves is that almost everybody has their own level and music from their game. You can fight on a Pokemon Center, the Great Fox, Brinstar Depths, or in Dreamland to name a few levels. The only characters that don't have their own level or share one with another character are Ness, Captain Falcon, Jigglypuff, and Luigi. It also has weapons from each characters game. The Bo-ombs, Ray Guns, Poke Balls, Hammers, and others. If you don't like items then you can turn them off which is another cool feature.Another thing about the game is that you have to unlock half of it. You have to beat the game with everyone which makes you appreciate each character's strength and weaknesses. Yoshi doesn't have a triple jump so you have to play to that weakness while Kirby has about 7 jumps which a strength. You have to learn to take advantage of your enemies weaknesses. If you see Samus charging up be ready to reflect it back with Fox.The best thing about this game is that you have to unlock half the things yourself. You have to unlock characters and levels. It is fun, especially since the single-player is great fun.What do you do after you unlock everything? Play multiplayer mode of course which is the best part of the game. You and up to 3 friends or AI duke it out in a free-for-all. Don't like playing by yourself, you can set it to teams with up to 3 teams(red, green, or blue) and fight that way. You can play by lives or by a time limit. You'll never get tired of this game and be popping it in every so often for years to come.\",\n",

The controls are extremely precise, and it\\'s possible to execute combos to near perfection. Indeed, combos are key to this game, something most players seem not to understand. Melee seems to have been created to eliminate combos and reduce fighting to random hacking and button-mashing; this is perfectly suited to mentally deficient monkeys, but humans with brains might prefer something that takes a little bit of skill. The only problem with SSB is that the combos can become degenerate, and certain characters are simply not viable, but most players don\\'t seem good enough to take advantage of this (almost no one thinks Jigglypuff is anything more than a pathetic waste of a spot, for instance) so enjoy!',\n",

This game had some really impressive graphics on the N64 and once again shocked me at how incredible the graphics for N64 are.  The action is fast pace and never looses its touch and cause me to play hours and hours of none stop story mode AND just plain fighting it out with friends or bots.  The game is incredible and should be played by all Nintendo Fans.  I found this to be far superior then most fighting games But SSBM was better then this but hey this one is a classic!  It features some awesome Levels and great Handicapped matches.  It's cool how you can also set up any match you.  You can also try to beat time records in story mode so you can get New secret characters like Captain Falcon.  The game was very impressive and this is why I gave it the score it got.  Classic...Graphics...man the graphics are just amazing! Really great visuals almost all the games I review I give the visuals Good reviews but hey I can't help it?...ok!!!  Man the graphics for the characters are so cool.  I loved the character desighn for Samus especially.  Fox and Mario looked awesome too.  It ranks up with the other great N64 titles like Zelda.

None stop action and fast paces moves make this an action packed thrill ride of none stop ass kicking and you'll do even better if you get Kirby who is the best.

Ewww Samus never looked so good...blah!The sound is cutting edge punches, shooting and well...fighting..eheheh You can here Yoshi flying in the air from miles away and it is so detailed I think Nintendo Worked very hard on this Title.  The sound is above average, I know it's lame that I review sound but oh well who cares....Well Like I said the sound is above average and is very very very detailed.  Earns a star......well.......From Impressive Visuals to great nonstop action filled fun with some really great Nintendo characters like Samus and Mario to very detailed sound.

Their rules were a bit similar, and every fighting game was like that.......until Smash Bros came along!Super Smash Bros reinvented the rules of fighting games, combining platforming with fighting moves, such as punching, kicking, etc. What's even more of a no-brainer is how several Nintendo franchises crossed over to star in this one game. Each character has their own abilities, such as Mario throwing fireballs, and Fox using his laser gun.There are a variety of stages to choose from, and most of them have their own gimmicks. The Mushroom Kingdom (unlcokable) has pipes you can go into, and Pokemon Stadium lets you open a door that certain Pokemon pop out of and attack.The 1-Player Mode is a series of battles, like how fighting games usually are. Unfortunately, the rosters of the battles don't change.However, overall, you'll get a huge kick out of this game, especially when it comes to playing multiplayer. 4 players duking it out...what more can you ask for?

I hope it helps you :)[EDIT] Here I was nice enough to post everything for you:Cheat: 999%There are two ways to to do this, you must pick Mario as your character and you must go to Hyrule Castle as a stage (you can fight any opponent you want). At Hyrule Castle, get your chosen opponent to the top wooden platform, and then push him or her off of the platform on the left side. Then, spawn as many green shells as you can on the right side of the platform. From here, go to the middle platform and go to the edge of the left side, facing left. Do Mario\\'s Up + B move - if done correctly, your opponent\\'s percentage will go up to 999%. Then, simply wait a second, and knock your opponent off the screen. The other way that takes longer, but is easier. Just select any chracter that shoots projectiles, like mario, luigi, and fox then keep hurting your opponent at the practice level of any selection until they get 999% and after hit the opponent and see them fly like a missle.Unlockable: Mushroom KingdomTo unlock the Mushroom Kingdom beat the game with all eight original characters. This will open up a level that resembles an old-school Super Mario Bros. level.Change Outfits:You can change your character\\'s outfits by tapping the four C Buttons at the character select screen. Some costume changes are limited to colors, but characters like Pikachu are also available with a hat.Unlockable Luigi:To play as Luigi, pass the Bonus Practice 1 with at least 8 main characters like the ones you didn\\'t have to unlock. When Luigi challenges you, defeat him and he\\'s yours.Kirby\\'s Power Loss:Everybody knows that Kirby can swallow his opponents and take on some of their powers in this game, but what if you accidentally \"ate\" a character you didn\\'t want -- and you want to pursue someone else? Simple: Just press the L Button to pull of Kirby\\'s \"Hello!\" taunt and he will discard whatever power he took on.JigglypuffIf you want to get the Pokemon Jigglypuff all you have to do is beat the game one time and then you will face JigglyPuff in a battle. If you beat JigglyPuff you will be able to use her in the game.Unlockable: Item Switch MenuTo unlock the Item menu (where players determine weapons and their frequency), play Vs. mode at least 50 times.Unlockable: Captain FalconTo play as Captain Falcon, you must beat the game on any difficulty with however many lives in UNDER 20 MINUTES. After that Captain Falcon will challenge you. Once you beat him, you be able to select Captain Falcon as a character.Unlockakle: NessTo play as Ness, beat the one-player mode with any character, with the number of starting lives set to 3 and the difficulty set to NORMAL. You must beat the game without continuing.Unlockable: Sound TestTo activate the Sound Test, successfully complete Bonus Practice games 1 and 2 with all characters &iquest; including the hidden ones. The Test Music option will appear on the Data screen.Quick Recovery:Have you ever been hit so far you haven\\'t been able to get back into the game to help your buddies?

There are an extra 4 unlockable characters, making the grand total 12! The game also features many items from different nintendo brands. Baseball bat from Ness\\'s world. Ray gun from Star Fox\\'s area. Invinciablity star from Kirby\\'s dreamworld. Fire flower from Mario land, and many others! Even features the orignal hammer!! There is only one thing bad about the game....... It only has 8 sceens to battle in! They are Sector Z, Peaches Castle, Dreamland, Planet Zebes, Yoshi\\'s Island, Hyrule Temple, Congo Jungle and Safforon City. The sceens are\\'t that bad though. You even get the choice: RANDOM. Another good thing is that up to 4 players can play!!! Or, if you don\\'t have any bros of sisters, you can fight up to three computer players!! You can also change the CP\\'s level from easy, to medium to hard! The controls are easy to learn and fun to use! It also contains \"1 Player \"Adventure Mode\"!\" This game is truely the best!! You will never get tired of it!! (I\\'ve had it for 4 days now, and I\\'ve been playing it night and day!!) One of the last features of it is that it has \"Break the Targets\" and the new to SSBM and SSBB \"Board the Platforms\"!!! You can even change your characters color if you want!Here are the character\"s ratings:Mario---He\\'s ok if you like simple gameplay.---B button=fireball.Kirby---He\\'s kinda like an ultimate character because of his swallow power.---B button=swallow.Samus Aran---She\\'s the best are doging. She\\'s also a little good at shooting too.---B button=shoot super blast.DK---He\\'s one of the best at throwing.---R Shoulder button=grab and throw.Yoshi---He\\'s awsome at getting back to land when thrown far. He\\'s also good with attacking.---Left arrow/right arrow of C pad + Joystick Left/ Right = Huge jump.Pikachu---Great at getting people from a distance!---A button=shock bolt.Link---Awesome at attacking and fighting!!!!---Joystick up + B button=huge sword wave.Fox Mccould---The fastest of them all!!!! He\\'s also excellent at getting back to ground when thrown far.---Double Joystick tap=super fast dash.----------------------------------------------------------Luigi---The same as Mario, only a little more powerful on attacks.---A button=punch/kick combo.Jigglypuff---WHY DID THEY EVEN PUT HIM IN THIS GAME!!!! THE WEAKEST, THE SLOWEST, THE EASEST KNOCKED OUTEST!!!! HE STINKS!!!!!! (Why couldn\\'t they have put Falco in his place??)Captain Falcon---Awesome at attacking and a little fast.---B button=\"Falcon Punch\"Ness---I haven\\'t unlocked him yet :(Buy it!!',\n",

       " 'Super Smash Brothers is one of the most unique ideas to hit the gaming world since first person shooters featured deathmatch.  For this game it features numerouse memorable nintendo characters such as Link, MArio, Pikachu, Samus Arron, Fox Mcloud and more in basically a battle royal.  The real fun is wehn you gather a group of friends and go into battle.  The action is almost always intense.  However I do have a few complaints about the game.1: Character Diversity.  On the primary roster Three of the 8 basic characters come from one form or another of the mario universe (Donkey Kong, Yoshi, MArio) and then Luigi as a hidden characeter.  So basically after all the hidden charactres are unlocked (a royal pain in the ***) one thrid of the roster comes from the mario universe.2: Story Mode: Basically in story mode you go through variouse fights, one on one, an army of characters, tag team, handicap, so on until you face the master hand and in the end it turns out your character is just a (What you thought I was going to spoil the ending).So overall this game is great if you have a bunch of friends over, however I would rather own the Gamecube version and that basically this is a rental for a weekend party.',\n",

Then buy one to play this game!FINAL RATING: 5/5',\n",
       " \"Have you ever wondered who would win in a fight, Mario or Jigglypuff? If Link went up to face Donkey Kong, would he stand a chance? In Super Smash Bros., the creators of the game take all of your favorite, well known Nintendo characters and throw them into one game. You can choose from several characters like Mario, Luigi, Pikachu, Link, Kirby and many more to battle against each other until there is only one left standing.It's a great game to play with your friends and see who is the best Super Smash Bros. player there is. Whether your favorite player to choose from is Samus Aran or Fox McCloud, each player has his or her own special abilities that can help you and your character win the fight.There are many pros to this game that include the vast amount of entertainment it provides with exciting items that appear randomly during battle to keep players interested. You can find poke balls to throw at other opponents, or swords and bats you can use to hit other people. It's a really fun game to play with people your own age, and its what I think to be one of the more entertaining games on the Nintendo 64.The only cons I can really say about this game are that the creators didn't include enough of our beloved Nintendo characters. Even though they had most of them, I would have enjoyed seeing just a few more of my favorite Nintendo characters battle to the death!Overall I rate this game a 5 out of 5 for its creativity, entertainment, good use of graphics, and the sound quality.\",\n",

There are 8 regular battle arenas (themed after the 8 characters) and 1 secret one.  Starting with three basic moves and playing with another novice, you can master all of the characters and all of their moves.  This game is unfortunately rigidly divided by skill, and good players will consistently beat worse ones.  I recommend this for everyone, especially those who enjoy games that require quick descisions.\",\n",

The fighting mechanics are still awesome and function well, the environments are still cool, the destruciton of your enemies or a friend is still loads of fun. Although this game has likely been forgotten since the launch of its Gamecube sequel, it's still a classic that should not be forgotten by any fighting fan. There's still fun stuff to unlock, like new characters. The only complaint I have against this game is the fact that it feels too easy at times. Still it never gets old to kick the crap out of Jigglypuff and send her flying or Pikachu.\",\n",

I was a master at this game, I loves it so much, a character I recommend that all beginners should use would be Fox, he is the easiest to use, but he is also very good if you can use him right. Jigglypuff and Ness are not for beginners, but Metronome might be the strongest move in the game. This is a fantastic game, unlock characters, set new records for your vs matches because every match you have goes down into the record column. This is a must have for N64 whether you are 10 or 20! Remember though, play with friends, not by yourself!\",\n",

       " \"I bought a used version of this cartridge after seeing my 3-year old son being hooked with it during a visit to my sister's.You have 8 characters to choose from with 4 additional hidden characters you can release after succeeding in various playing modes at specific difficulty levels.  Each character has its own set of special moves, sounds and taunts.The purpose of the game is to use your character skills and moves to knock off your opponent from the hovering playing field.  Damage to you or to your opponent builds up as you hit him/her.  Some punches or moves give more damage than others and as the damaged builds up, the character turns more vulnerable to being knocked off.There are a few moves that only give damage and other moves are used to specifically knock off your opponent.  This means that you cannot just push buttons at random, it requires a lot of patience and some reflexes to defeat your adversary consistently.The game is extremely simple to learn, yet there are quite a large amount of special moves to master.  You will definitely require all those special moves when playing the most advanced levels or when facing more skilled human opponents.I kind of sticked with Mario when playing, for me it is the most well-rounded character, although I'm sure  that some of the hidden characters are quite versatile as well.I found out that this game can be handicap adjusted, making it fun and fair for all ages and skill levels.This game is definitely more fun in a multi-player scenario, but it is also extremely fun using the computer as an opponent.  You can play a free-for-all match (everyone against everyone) with up to 3 computer (or human) controlled characters, having each one the same or their own unique skill levels.  There is also a Team-Battle, where you team up with a computer or a human to face another human/computer team.One small thing I did noticed was some slow control response in some instances, especially when playing the harder levels; it requires a little patience getting used to it.This game is very easy to learn, extremely addictive, colorful, fun, challenging and funny.  It has dozens of playing options and many cool sounds. It is quite entertaining with lots of clean fun for the whole family.5 stars and 100% recommended.\",\n",
       " \"This game is the best. The only thing I didn't like about this game is that the graphics were not the best. If you're a first time N64 buyer, get this game! It's really fun, and pretty competitive. It is even better when you have friends to play with.\",\n",
       " 'This has to be one of the best games I have ever played. The whole concept of nintendo characters pounding other nintendo characters into oblivion is interesting, and very fun. The Comical and Chaotic feeling of running around and bashing other players of the field in multyplayer fun. You play as one of twelve characters; four of which must be unlocked.  The basic characters are all easy to play with, and relatively popular. They are as follows: Kirby (Kirby), Mario (Mario), Link (Zelda), Samus Aran (Super Metroid), Donkey Kong (Donkey Kong), Fox McCloud (Star Fox), Pikachu (Pokemon), Yoshi (Mario). Most of these should be familiar to the moderate gamer, with the exception of Samus, a popular GB character with Metroid.  There are many items in this game that you can collect to boost progress. You can get a light saber type thing, making an adequate weapon for plasy. You can also get a fire flower (Mario Bros), Pokeball (Pokemon), and ray gun (star fox). You can also get a Star Man, making you invincible, and a hammer, letting you smash other opponents out of the match.The damage and knock out works like this: With each attack landed on an opponent, their damage percentage goes up. The higher the percentage, the farther and faster each player will fly after each hit. Players can fall off the edge of the map, or fly too high and fall into the horizon.  In single player mode, you fight computer controlled characters on many different stages. You earn points based on how well you do (ie how fast you defeat all the enemies) and what you do (ie using the same move the whole stage). Eventually you can fight the master hand, boss of the last stage. Once you beat him, you have the opportinity to unlock hidden characters, Luigi (Mario), Jigglypuff(Pokemon), Ness(EarthBound), and Captain Falcon(FZero Racing). You also try for the highest score.Multiplayer can be more fun. You basically go through a skirmish against 1 to 3 other players, whether controlled by the computer or a human. The items will apply, and you can turn them on or off by playing 50 multiplayer games and unlocking the item switch. After you end the time limit with more points than all other players / if everyone else is out of lives, you get ranked 1st 2nd 3rd or 4th, and the stats of the game are sent into the game stats bank, which you can look over.You can also practice some of the stages of the game, trying for the best time. If you persist in this, you can unlock luigi. It is always good to get practice.Overall, this game deserves a more than five stars. It is very fun, and it provides endless entertainment.',\n",
       " \"Many well known (and some not so well known)classic Nintendo characters fight it out here.Imagine Mario against Link?IS that possible?Here it is, you can even throw in a Pikachu!.The combat system is easy enough and each character has a blend of moves and taunts.Some characters are good for close rang while others are good at middle ground.The levels branch off from the characters own worlds.Like Link would have a castle roof top to fight on.Yoshi would have a little story book zone and so on.Colors can be changed for the outfits so you can tell who's who if you play as the same character as oneanother.The weapons span out from each of the characters franchises with a Mario fire flower and so on.I can't believe how exspensive this is this is truly a must have.\",\n",

Mario can perfect his fireball move, Fox McCloud can shoot his laser, Link can throw boomerangs and bombs, while little kirby can suck up players and steal there secret powers. All characters have different special attacks. They can all punch and kick, but they all throw, smash, pound, pummle, blast and burn diffrently. Also, items fall down from the sky that you can use againts your opponents. Pokeballs, (which actually contain several random pokemon that each do different things) swords, hammers, Maximum Tomatoes and fire-flowers all rain down so you can reign over everyone on the field. With an awesome multiplayer option, this is a sure Nintendo Classic. Try this game, you'll fall in love with it fast.\",\n",

       " \"Super Smash Brothers... I remember reading in a magazine about this game and thinking, &quot;Finally a game that's going to be a smash!&quot;. A year or so later when I played it for the first time, my hopes were confirmed. This title is one if the best, if not the best, fighting and party game for the N64. Not being much of a Mortal Kombat fan, because of the blood and gore, I was happy to finally see a game that was fun, innovating and bloodless. No, no finishing moves in this game. :-)Super Smash brothers is exactly what the name says, a smash. With 8 available Nintendo stars to choose from at first and 4 hidden away to be unlocked later, this game is a major intrest-getter. Great Nintendo stars are avalaible to fight with such as Pikachu, Link, Kirby, Donkey Kong,etc. and keep the game fun and exciting. There is a hidden level to unlock and secret options to uncover, guaranteeing that you won't want to put the game down till you have them all.As a fun factor and replay value this game definitley rates way over a five. The game supports up to 4-players at once, making it a great party game. All you need is some popcorn, a couple of sodas and a few pillows and the night is made. You can play with computer controlled characters and also as teams, up to three diferent teams at once. The one player game is very fun and challenging too.  SSB contains no blood or gore making it a great title for anyone. Parents will be happy about that matter because I know how some parents don't apreciate blood, gore and guts in a game.The gameplay rates very high also.Gameplay is easy to learn, fast and furious. The action keeps you on your toes and you fingers twitching at the controls.  The levels and graphics are smooth and cool. Sometimes during a 4-player match the game will go into slow-motion for a couple of seconds. Some gamers see this as a problem but I think sometimes it adds to the effect of the game. Also some elements or weapons are in 2-d making thme seem like paper but this does not detract from the game at all. Some levels are cute, like the Yoshi level and the Kirby one, while others have a sort of seriousness to them, Fox's and Link are examples. All the levels have some sort of hazard to them like a plane coming and shooting lasers at you or  a tree blowing you off the screen, adding to the fun and challenge rate. But no matter what level you play on the graphics a clean,very crisp and the levels are very fun.This title is really great for a bunch of friends or just for yourself and is definitley a game that even parents can learn to play. So that makes it in a way a great way to spend time with your kids too. For the kids, this is a great title for new or experienced gamers. This game is worth every penny of what you spend on it.A party bash, a rainy day, you shouldn't stall , it's great for all. :-)  From an owner and gamer, Andrew H. King.\",\n",

You can set up the difficulties and also set up how many lives you can use.Multiplayer mode is also fun. You have the ability to play in teams or not. Still you can set up the difficulties.

I think everyone will have a good time except those people that think games are only good when there is blood and gore. (Read some of the other reviews and you'll see what I mean.) There are so many good things about this game that 1000 words isn't enough. I will tell you the cons instead of wasting time and words. CONS: Hard to get secret characters, Not enough Pokemon Characters, More Characters Should Be In It such as: Turok, Princess Peach, Zelda, Wario, Bowser, Diddy Kong, Dixie Kong, Charmander, Mewtwo, Bomberman, Goemon, Yae, Ebisumaru, Sasuke, Impact, James Bond, and others.

But it's also bad; there's a limited number of moves.Also, some characters are really useless. Jigglypuff? One Pokemon was enough, but this is even a crapified version of Kirby. Which takes me to number two. Kirby. I like the character an the developers had teh right idea, but hes too strong. Playing against aKirby gets really cheap...I'm sure some of you know what I mean. His brick can protect him from about anything!There's only 9 stages...a few of which are really bad like Kirby's, and the Pokemon one's not too great either. But there's good ones also like Hyrule, Fox, Mario and the Donkey. Then there's the nostalgic ones.This game is great, especially because of its small learning curve and awesome replay value(the best next to goldeneye). Definitely worth your money.\",\n",

It could range from a spaceship in the star-e-ness of space to the tops of skyscrapers!Each fighter has their own special moves and abilities to crush other fighters with.

You can run around on vast terrains, where items such as light sabers (Samus Aron or Star Fox, I don't know), pokeballs (Pokemon), hammers(The original Donkey Kong arcade), and lasers (Star Fox) fall from the sky, and are at whoever grabs them first's disposal. The levels are:Mario Brother's flying island thingie, Zelda's castle, Saffaron City, Star Fox's ship, Samus Aaron's near-destructed planet, Donkey Kong's jungle, Yosie's island, and Kirby's planet. There's also a hidden level, The Mario Brother's classic arcade world. And, now, the players:Mario, Yoshi, Kirby, Star Fox, Samus Aron, Donkey Kong, Link, and...Pikachu. And, there a 4 bonus characters, and I'll tell ya how to get them:Jigglypuff-All you have to do is beat the game, on any mode, no matter how many lives you lose.Captain Falcon-Beat the whole game on any challenge level in under 20 minutes.Ness-Beat the game on normal with only 3 lives, without getting any game overs.Luigi-Go to pratice and beat everyone's (except the bonus character's) bonus game 1. Luigi is faster and stronger than Mario.HAVE FUN!!\",\n",

The controls were hard and there were too many moves to remember. But once you get around the learning curve, which only took a day or 2, the game is a great ride.The thing about the game is that it has everybody's favorite Nintendo characters in one game. It doesn't even skip on the moves. You can throw Link's boomerang, Samus Aran's morphing ball bombs, Mario's fireballs, Jigglypuff's sing, and many other characters moves. The graphics for the game were excellent at the time and still look better than any N64 game except Mario 64.Not only do you have every characters special moves is that almost everybody has their own level and music from their game. You can fight on a Pokemon Center, the Great Fox, Brinstar Depths, or in Dreamland to name a few levels. The only characters that don't have their own level or share one with another character are Ness, Captain Falcon, Jigglypuff, and Luigi. It also has weapons from each characters game. The Bo-ombs, Ray Guns, Poke Balls, Hammers, and others. If you don't like items then you can turn them off which is another cool feature.Another thing about the game is that you have to unlock half of it. You have to beat the game with everyone which makes you appreciate each character's strength and weaknesses. Yoshi doesn't have a triple jump so you have to play to that weakness while Kirby has about 7 jumps which a strength. You have to learn to take advantage of your enemies weaknesses. If you see Samus charging up be ready to reflect it back with Fox.The best thing about this game is that you have to unlock half the things yourself. You have to unlock characters and levels. It is fun, especially since the single-player is great fun.What do you do after you unlock everything? Play multiplayer mode of course which is the best part of the game. You and up to 3 friends or AI duke it out in a free-for-all. Don't like playing by yourself, you can set it to teams with up to 3 teams(red, green, or blue) and fight that way. You can play by lives or by a time limit. You'll never get tired of this game and be popping it in every so often for years to come.\",\n",

The controls are extremely precise, and it\\'s possible to execute combos to near perfection. Indeed, combos are key to this game, something most players seem not to understand. Melee seems to have been created to eliminate combos and reduce fighting to random hacking and button-mashing; this is perfectly suited to mentally deficient monkeys, but humans with brains might prefer something that takes a little bit of skill. The only problem with SSB is that the combos can become degenerate, and certain characters are simply not viable, but most players don\\'t seem good enough to take advantage of this (almost no one thinks Jigglypuff is anything more than a pathetic waste of a spot, for instance) so enjoy!',\n",

This game had some really impressive graphics on the N64 and once again shocked me at how incredible the graphics for N64 are.  The action is fast pace and never looses its touch and cause me to play hours and hours of none stop story mode AND just plain fighting it out with friends or bots.  The game is incredible and should be played by all Nintendo Fans.  I found this to be far superior then most fighting games But SSBM was better then this but hey this one is a classic!  It features some awesome Levels and great Handicapped matches.  It's cool how you can also set up any match you.  You can also try to beat time records in story mode so you can get New secret characters like Captain Falcon.  The game was very impressive and this is why I gave it the score it got.

None stop action and fast paces moves make this an action packed thrill ride of none stop ass kicking and you'll do even better if you get Kirby who is the best.

Ewww Samus never looked so good...blah!The sound is cutting edge punches, shooting and well...fighting..eheheh You can here Yoshi flying in the air from miles away and it is so detailed I think Nintendo Worked very hard on this Title.  The sound is above average, I know it's lame that I review sound but oh well who cares....Well Like I said the sound is above average and is very very very detailed.

Their rules were a bit similar, and every fighting game was like that.......until Smash Bros came along!Super Smash Bros reinvented the rules of fighting games, combining platforming with fighting moves, such as punching, kicking, etc. What's even more of a no-brainer is how several Nintendo franchises crossed over to star in this one game. Each character has their own abilities, such as Mario throwing fireballs, and Fox using his laser gun.There are a variety of stages to choose from, and most of them have their own gimmicks. The Mushroom Kingdom (unlcokable) has pipes you can go into, and Pokemon Stadium lets you open a door that certain Pokemon pop out of and attack.The 1-Player Mode is a series of battles, like how fighting games usually are. Unfortunately, the rosters of the battles don't change.However, overall, you'll get a huge kick out of this game, especially when it comes to playing multiplayer. 4 players duking it out...what more can you ask for?

You can have timed battles or die from losing lives.Pros:1) Fun multiplayer action2) Computer feature is great---you can set computers skill level3) Good training level, where you can control many things, and add items and make the computer do things to help you train4) Just Great!!Cons:1) Certain characters are hard to get (like Ness)2) Less advanced than Super Smash Bros Melee3) Controls are sometimes difficultThis is a great gift for anyone who is young (especially) and for anyone with a N64.',\n",

There\\'s even a new level (Mushroom Kingdom Classic.) I hope it helps you :)[EDIT] Here I was nice enough to post everything for you:Cheat: 999%There are two ways to to do this, you must pick Mario as your character and you must go to Hyrule Castle as a stage (you can fight any opponent you want). At Hyrule Castle, get your chosen opponent to the top wooden platform, and then push him or her off of the platform on the left side. Then, spawn as many green shells as you can on the right side of the platform. From here, go to the middle platform and go to the edge of the left side, facing left. Do Mario\\'s Up + B move - if done correctly, your opponent\\'s percentage will go up to 999%. Then, simply wait a second, and knock your opponent off the screen. The other way that takes longer, but is easier. Just select any chracter that shoots projectiles, like mario, luigi, and fox then keep hurting your opponent at the practice level of any selection until they get 999% and after hit the opponent and see them fly like a missle.Unlockable: Mushroom KingdomTo unlock the Mushroom Kingdom beat the game with all eight original characters. This will open up a level that resembles an old-school Super Mario Bros. level.Change Outfits:You can change your character\\'s outfits by tapping the four C Buttons at the character select screen. Some costume changes are limited to colors, but characters like Pikachu are also available with a hat.Unlockable Luigi:To play as Luigi, pass the Bonus Practice 1 with at least 8 main characters like the ones you didn\\'t have to unlock. When Luigi challenges you, defeat him and he\\'s yours.Kirby\\'s Power Loss:Everybody knows that Kirby can swallow his opponents and take on some of their powers in this game, but what if you accidentally \"ate\" a character you didn\\'t want -- and you want to pursue someone else? Simple: Just press the L Button to pull of Kirby\\'s \"Hello!\" taunt and he will discard whatever power he took on.JigglypuffIf you want to get the Pokemon Jigglypuff all you have to do is beat the game one time and then you will face JigglyPuff in a battle. If you beat JigglyPuff you will be able to use her in the game.Unlockable: Item Switch MenuTo unlock the Item menu (where players determine weapons and their frequency), play Vs. mode at least 50 times.Unlockable: Captain FalconTo play as Captain Falcon, you must beat the game on any difficulty with however many lives in UNDER 20 MINUTES. After that Captain Falcon will challenge you. Once you beat him, you be able to select Captain Falcon as a character.Unlockakle: NessTo play as Ness, beat the one-player mode with any character, with the number of starting lives set to 3 and the difficulty set to NORMAL. You must beat the game without continuing.Unlockable: Sound TestTo activate the Sound Test, successfully complete Bonus Practice games 1 and 2 with all characters &iquest; including the hidden ones. The Test Music option will appear on the Data screen.Quick Recovery:Have you ever been hit so far you haven\\'t been able to get back into the game to help your buddies? After being hit into the air, tap Z as soon as you hit the ground. When you hit the ground, you will spring up from the ground quickly, and you can be back in the game faster.

On the primary roster Three of the 8 basic characters come from one form or another of the mario universe (Donkey Kong, Yoshi, MArio) and then Luigi as a hidden characeter.  So basically after all the hidden charactres are unlocked (a royal pain in the ***) one thrid of the roster comes from the mario universe.2: Story Mode: Basically in story mode you go through variouse fights, one on one, an army of characters, tag team, handicap, so on until you face the master hand and in the end it turns out your character is just a (What you thought I was going to spoil the ending).So overall this game is great if you have a bunch of friends over, however I would rather own the Gamecube version and that basically this is a rental for a weekend party.',\n",

Whether your favorite player to choose from is Samus Aran or Fox McCloud, each player has his or her own special abilities that can help you and your character win the fight.There are many pros to this game that include the vast amount of entertainment it provides with exciting items that appear randomly during battle to keep players interested. You can find poke balls to throw at other opponents, or swords and bats you can use to hit other people. It's a really fun game to play with people your own age, and its what I think to be one of the more entertaining games on the Nintendo 64.The only cons I can really say about this game are that the creators didn't include enough of our beloved Nintendo characters.

There's also extra content like the ability to print images from the GB printer (sold separately), a program that tells you where the Yoshi eggs are hidden, a built in calendar and a fortune teller program.The CONS: None.It's a must own title back then and a real treat to play nowadays if you still have the Game Boy Color or Game Boy Advance SP. It was cool to bring around the original game with you (with the ability to save anywhere) but the extra modes and content really made it worth its price. Track down a copy because it's one game you will never ever get tired of playing.\",\n",

Thankfully  Nintendo rereleased the game a few times ( Super Mario all-stars/SNES Wii, NES Classic/ GBA, Virtual Console/Wii 3ds WiiU, And Super Mario Bros Deluxe/ Gameboy Color GBA ) This might be the best. It kept the original look unlike all-stars which might put some disappointed but it is a look that can't be beaten. It add a save feature, Boo race, red coin hunt, and even achievements!

At that particular time, the only other way that anyone could access those levels was to play Super Mario All Stars for the Super NES/Nintendo Wii.  However, the NES Japanese levels were finally included on this 1999 Game Boy Color port/remake.  (For those of you history buffs, the Japanese version of Super Mario Bros. was actually named Super Mario Bros. 2.  The North American version of SMB2 was completely different and released in 1988 with Wart as the main archvillain, not Bowser.)I actually find the Japanese version of the levels very satisfying and much more challenging.  Some unusual effects will happen, such as Mario/Luigi jumping off a trampoline and into the air off screen for a couple of seconds, entering a \"negative\" warp pipe that brings you back several worlds (i.e., instead of going FORWARD), or seeing Goombas walking in the water levels.Super Mario Bros. Deluxe is one of those games that I could NEVER ever quit playing, even if I wanted to.  So stop reading this already and get this game!! Sadly, Super Mario Bros.

When I went to Target to get a game, since Pokemon Pinball wasn't there, I got this game instead. I realized that this game was a better choice than Pokemon Pinball. First off, the graphics are marvelous, and proves that GBC is just as good as the NES, if not better. Another thing good about this game is the new save system(I knew it was new because I had a friend who had the original for the NES). They also installed a new challenge mode which is very tough, but later in the game, there is a new item in the Toy Box that gives hints to where all the Yoshi Eggs are. The Toy Box has options like Fortune telling which can be very amusing(And get you five more lives to start with if you get an Extremely Lucky card) and tons of printouts for the Game Boy Printer. You might also want to have a Link Cable and a friend with this game handy for the Vs. Mode. In this mode, you can race your opponent on the special race courses. You can also play this mode in one-player, with Boo as your opponent. There is also a new Photo Gallery, which takes a picture every time you do something new, like stomp a new enemy, or trade high scores with a friend with the Infared sensor. Yes, I said high scores, another new feature. But this is all aside from the main game. The game isn't really too challenging until the last world, but I noticed that you can jump higher in this game than any other 2D Mario adventure I've played so far. Once you beat the main game, you get the Star levels, which are a little more challenging anyway. And once you get the high score, you can get to the Lost Levels, which are EXTREMELY hard, and the last of them has TWO Bowsers! Definetly a great buy, because of all the time put into a game like this.\",\n",

It doesn't quite capture the magic many of us old school gamers can remember the first time we saw that screen on our TVs.  But the Golden Age of the video gaming industry has passed, and we must continue on.  Sorry for getting nostalgic, but there's still nothing quite as memorable these days as playing the old NES years ago, with a lot of friends gathered around.  Perhaps I romantize that era to much of the video game industry, but I have a lot of good memories from that.  That's how boys bond (and also men - me and my best friends still go and play the N64 --- the latest wrestling game from THQ and Goldeneye always come in handy).  And for those parents who are concerned with some of the more mature elements in gaming these days - don't worry, Mario doesn't have anything to be concerned about.Anyway, this includes some new features, like challenges (find Yoshi's Egg, 5 red coins, and beat a specified high score), races with Boo, a Toy Box (or something along those lines), and some trophies.  Also, more intriguing, is that that included the Japanese SMB II or Lost Levels for us American and UK folks or gamers I mean.  You have to get 300,000 points on the original, and then Luigi's head will appear on the gaming menu.  Its retitled SUPER MARIO BROTHERS FOR SUPER PLAYERS, and you have to be one to beat it, the difficulty level is so high.  It took us a good 13 years to get the game in original 8 bit format.  One thing about the screen: its not big enough to get the entire game inside it, so they have Mario look up and down.All in all, a good adaptation.  Still, it'd be nice to see the release of more games like this -- mainly the first two LEGEND OF ZELDA games on one cart.  Why don't they do this??  Perhaps with the release of the two new GB Colour Zelda games (they divided one game into halves and stuck it on the remaining two) we'll see a release of those two classic Zelda titles.

Having not played the game in years, I was craving some Mario and decided to dust Super Mario Bros. Deluxe off; I'm glad that I did. I forgot not only how well this game transitions to the small screen, but just how many features Nintendo managed to cram into the game. There is huge replay value to be had here, which comes in the form of an additional full game, side challenges, and other minigames. While the original Super Mario Bros. was pretty challenging, the developers have added a save anytime and endless continues to ease the frustration level of the player. The only demerit the game gets from me is the fact that the whole game doesn't fit on the screen, so you have to move up and down accordingly, which caused me to lose a couple lives because of an enemy that I couldn't originally see on the screen. I don't need to write up anything about the gameplay, chances are you've played a side-scrolling Mario game at some point of your life. If you haven't, stop reading this and go play right now.

       " 'It\\'s been nearly fifteen years since the plumber wandered into the Mushroom Kingdom, and gaming has never been the same since. When the NES was released in 1985, the game that shipped with the system was the instant classic Super Mario Bros. And what better way to kick off the first year of the Game Boy Color\\'s life than with a true Mario game? The Game Boy Color game Super Mario Bros. Deluxe is a pixel-by-pixel translation of the original NES game, with a ton of added features. And because the original Super Mario Bros. still holds up extremely well after all these years, Super Mario Bros. Deluxe is an absolutely fantastic game that borders on perfection ? perfection in Game Boy standards, of course. There are many different modes in the game, but the main game is the 1985 classic Super Mario Bros. 32 levels of platform-hopping gameplay where you must go through the world, jumping on enemies and collecting coins, making your way to the next castle before time runs out. Collect 100 coins and you\\'ve earned a secret life. Make sure you jump on...aww, skip it. You\\'ve played this game before. What you haven\\'t played are the new modes injected in the Game Boy Color version. The Vs. Mode requires two Game Boy Colors and a link-cable, but this game is a whole lot of fun. It\\'s a race to the flag pole between Mario and Luigi, and you\\'ll try to screw each other up by hitting triggers that will put blocks up in the way. Very cool use of the original Super Mario Bros. engine, and worth the purchase of another cartridge just for this feature alone. Super Mario Bros. Deluxe also has a Challenge Mode, where you\\'ll have to find five red coins and a Yoshi egg, as well as beat the level\\'s preset score to finish the level completely. This is pretty darn difficult, hope you have a lot of patience. When I say pixel-perfect, I mean it. Even though the Game Boy Color screen has less resolution than a standard television, the developers have translated the same pixel count for every object in the game, from Mario to the koopas, turtles, even the question-mark blocks. Granted, this reduces the screen visibility somewhat, but the developers have added user-controlled screen-scrolling to the mix. If you want to see above or below where you\\'re standing, it\\'s all a matter of pushing up or down on the pad. All 32 levels, from 1-1 to 8-4 are patterned after the levels in the NES classic. Nothing\\'s changed. Well, that\\'s not exactly true, you can now save your game in progress, something you could not do in the original. It also remembers which levels you\\'ve completed, and unlocks secrets based on how many you\\'ve finished. So it\\'s not always a good thing to find the warp zones so early in the game. Secrets? That\\'s right. As you complete certain tasks in the game, you open up little hidden trinkets. Things like a Photo Album where you can print out earned pictures on your Game Boy Printer, or a Toy Box where you can make messages and print them out. Oh, and just because they could, the developers stuck in a fortune teller (just think \"Mario Magic 8 Ball\") and a calendar option where you can enter important dates and save them to a cartridge. Do they need to be in there? Of course not. But they\\'re cool additions nontheless. Super Mario Bros. remains one of my top 10 favorite games of all-time, even though it\\'s almost a decade and a half old. Super Mario Bros. Deluxe is such a perfect translation, it makes me wonder if it\\'s easy to port NES games to the Game Boy Advance. Super Mario Bros. Deluxe is the Game Boy Color-specific game to own, hands down, and will be the title that, hopefully, will key a revolution of porting NES games to the handheld system. Buy this game. Now.',\n",
       " \"Super Mario Brothers Deluxe is an exact copy of the original Nintendo game.  All the same graphics, levels, and even cheats are the same.  Even if you beat the original game, this version has a few things added.  There's a mode where you race a friend or the computer, a table which has  all the Toads that you've unlocked which will let you print out banners and  such on the game boy printer, a fortune teller where if you are very lucky  you earn five extra lives, and a challenge mode where you have to have a  high score, gain red coins and find a yoshi's egg.  There is also a picture  gallery similar to Zelda Dx. which has pictures of enemies and scenes from  the game.  This game is pure fun.\",\n",
       " \"Super Mario Bros. for the NES revolutionized video gaming, no questions asked. Accordingly, a rerelease for the Game Boy Color seemed fitting. All 32 levels from the NES classic are back, in all their pixelated glory. The music is left unchanged from the NES as well! Plus, once you beat the 32 normal levels, you get to play through them again in an expert mode with tougher enemies more common and smaller lifts. Beat those and you get 32 NEW levels, from the Japanese version of Super Mario Bros. 2 (these are often called &quot;The Lost Levels&quot; in America.) In addition to these amazing features, there is a challenge mode where you must find a hidden Yoshi egg, 5 red coins, and get a high score. There's even a mode where you have to race to the end of a unique level against Boo!

       " \"The original Super Mario Brothers came out about the same time that I was born, and I think today its aged better than I have. Having not played the game in years, I was craving some Mario and decided to dust Super Mario Bros. Deluxe off; I'm glad that I did. I forgot not only how well this game transitions to the small screen, but just how many features Nintendo managed to cram into the game. There is huge replay value to be had here, which comes in the form of an additional full game, side challenges, and other minigames. While the original Super Mario Bros. was pretty challenging, the developers have added a save anytime and endless continues to ease the frustration level of the player. The only demerit the game gets from me is the fact that the whole game doesn't fit on the screen, so you have to move up and down accordingly, which caused me to lose a couple lives because of an enemy that I couldn't originally see on the screen. I don't need to write up anything about the gameplay, chances are you've played a side-scrolling Mario game at some point of your life. If you haven't, stop reading this and go play right now. Otherwise, this game is perfect for those craving a little old school Mario Brothers action.\",\n",
       " 'This game is the account to the SNES version, its graphics are way better than the original, it even holds alot of secrets, EX.

       " 'It\\'s been nearly fifteen years since the plumber wandered into the Mushroom Kingdom, and gaming has never been the same since. When the NES was released in 1985, the game that shipped with the system was the instant classic Super Mario Bros. And what better way to kick off the first year of the Game Boy Color\\'s life than with a true Mario game? The Game Boy Color game Super Mario Bros. Deluxe is a pixel-by-pixel translation of the original NES game, with a ton of added features. And because the original Super Mario Bros. still holds up extremely well after all these years, Super Mario Bros. Deluxe is an absolutely fantastic game that borders on perfection ? perfection in Game Boy standards, of course. There are many different modes in the game, but the main game is the 1985 classic Super Mario Bros. 32 levels of platform-hopping gameplay where you must go through the world, jumping on enemies and collecting coins, making your way to the next castle before time runs out. Collect 100 coins and you\\'ve earned a secret life. Make sure you jump on...aww, skip it. You\\'ve played this game before. What you haven\\'t played are the new modes injected in the Game Boy Color version. The Vs. Mode requires two Game Boy Colors and a link-cable, but this game is a whole lot of fun. It\\'s a race to the flag pole between Mario and Luigi, and you\\'ll try to screw each other up by hitting triggers that will put blocks up in the way. Very cool use of the original Super Mario Bros. engine, and worth the purchase of another cartridge just for this feature alone. Super Mario Bros. Deluxe also has a Challenge Mode, where you\\'ll have to find five red coins and a Yoshi egg, as well as beat the level\\'s preset score to finish the level completely. This is pretty darn difficult, hope you have a lot of patience. When I say pixel-perfect, I mean it. Even though the Game Boy Color screen has less resolution than a standard television, the developers have translated the same pixel count for every object in the game, from Mario to the koopas, turtles, even the question-mark blocks. Granted, this reduces the screen visibility somewhat, but the developers have added user-controlled screen-scrolling to the mix. If you want to see above or below where you\\'re standing, it\\'s all a matter of pushing up or down on the pad. All 32 levels, from 1-1 to 8-4 are patterned after the levels in the NES classic. Nothing\\'s changed. Well, that\\'s not exactly true, you can now save your game in progress, something you could not do in the original. It also remembers which levels you\\'ve completed, and unlocks secrets based on how many you\\'ve finished. So it\\'s not always a good thing to find the warp zones so early in the game. Secrets? That\\'s right. As you complete certain tasks in the game, you open up little hidden trinkets. Things like a Photo Album where you can print out earned pictures on your Game Boy Printer, or a Toy Box where you can make messages and print them out. Oh, and just because they could, the developers stuck in a fortune teller (just think \"Mario Magic 8 Ball\") and a calendar option where you can enter important dates and save them to a cartridge. Do they need to be in there? Of course not. But they\\'re cool additions nontheless. Super Mario Bros. remains one of my top 10 favorite games of all-time, even though it\\'s almost a decade and a half old. Super Mario Bros. Deluxe is such a perfect translation, it makes me wonder if it\\'s easy to port NES games to the Game Boy Advance. Super Mario Bros. Deluxe is the Game Boy Color-specific game to own, hands down, and will be the title that, hopefully, will key a revolution of porting NES games to the handheld system. Buy this game. Now.',\n",
       " \"Super Mario Brothers Deluxe is an exact copy of the original Nintendo game.  All the same graphics, levels, and even cheats are the same.  Even if you beat the original game, this version has a few things added.  There's a mode where you race a friend or the computer, a table which has  all the Toads that you've unlocked which will let you print out banners and  such on the game boy printer, a fortune teller where if you are very lucky  you earn five extra lives, and a challenge mode where you have to have a  high score, gain red coins and find a yoshi's egg.  There is also a picture  gallery similar to Zelda Dx. which has pictures of enemies and scenes from  the game.  This game is pure fun.\",\n",
       " \"Super Mario Bros. for the NES revolutionized video gaming, no questions asked. Accordingly, a rerelease for the Game Boy Color seemed fitting. All 32 levels from the NES classic are back, in all their pixelated glory. The music is left unchanged from the NES as well! Plus, once you beat the 32 normal levels, you get to play through them again in an expert mode with tougher enemies more common and smaller lifts. Beat those and you get 32 NEW levels, from the Japanese version of Super Mario Bros. 2 (these are often called &quot;The Lost Levels&quot; in America.) In addition to these amazing features, there is a challenge mode where you must find a hidden Yoshi egg, 5 red coins, and get a high score. There's even a mode where you have to race to the end of a unique level against Boo! Lastly, the game contains several extras you can print out with your Game Boy Printer, which increase in number as you progress through the game. BY ALL MEANS PURCHASE THIS GAME IF YOU OWN A GBC or GBA.\",\n",
       " \"I bought this color, Teal, because I liked teal very much. Other than that, this console has improved on its graphics! On games like Super Mario Bros. Deluxe and Pokemon Gold and Silver, the graphics are much better! Also, there is a ample amount of color that your eyes can feast on. Now if you have game boy Pocket and Regular game boy and you're playing Pokemon [It doesn't matter which one], you will notice that when you walk around in Pocket, It's very blurry. Well this fault has ben fixed in GameBoy Color. It's extremely helpful because it enables you to see more detail and little things that you couldn't see before. I also have some regular gameboy games that aren't for game boy color and if you play them on GameBoy color, they show little color, but no blurryness. Now make sure you read what the box says when you are buying a gameboy color game. There are two types, there is one that says FOR GAMEBOY COLOR ONLY, which you can't use on the other gameboys. The second type just says that it's for gameboy color. Those you can play on the regular gameboys. It won't show any color but at least you can play it. There are a couple faults for the gameboy color. One of which is that the console is too small [for me I have big fingers so it's hard for a grown up kid]. A second fault is that the batterys run out faster than the Original GameBoy [The gameboy pocket battery use is outrageous! I played the gameboy pocket for 2 hours straight and the batterys were already starting to run out[[I think it's because the console takes AAA's and they tend to run out fast]].]. The original gameboy lasted me up to 23 hours! This only lastes me for about 12. Well I can see why because of all the good color and good graphics.

In the summer of 2000,I bought Pokemon Stadium for N64 because I had just taken an interest. I did not know you needed the gameboy games(pretty stupid of me,eh?). So we bought me a kiwi colored gameboy color(too bad they had no berry color,but kiwi is just as pretty!). Along with it,I gotmy first game,Pokemon Yellow. And boy was it more than I expected. I played it hours on end! I could not put it down! I took it everywhere,in the car,resterants,grandparents',etc etc etc. It really spiced upmy summer. I kept on sticking to Pokemon games but soon I discovered more great games such as Zelda and Harvest Moon plus tins of others. I even think I enjoy it more than any other console I own(me and my brother practicly own all the systems(gamecube,PS2,dreamcast,n64,etc,etc). The batteries last a good 20 hours or so too,which is great for traveling. Yes,the gameboy advance may be out there too,and i bought one of those,but I almost think that I enjoy this more. I think gameboy color games seem to be more addicting and there are a lot more out at the present.I think the gameboy color is cooler looking than the GBA! Another great feature is that you can plug headphones in so you can play with sound without disturbing other people. I have recently broke my poor kiwi gameboy by accidently dropping it on the floor.Well,I guess we must get another one.

There is even a jack where you can plug in a little light so if you are playing in the dark, you can see what you are doing. Some of the best games on Game Boy Color are Monopoly, Ken Griffey Jr.'s Slugfest, All Star Baseball 2000, Pokemon Pinball and Tetris DX.

       " \"Although the Game Boy Advance is on the way, the original Game Boy (here in 'Colour' form) is still going strong, and is still the only mainstream  hand-held console.Compared with the sadly-missed Neo Geo Pocket the  screen is slightly less vibrant, and sorely needs a backlight (although  adding one would decimate the battery life). Technically, although the NGP  was 16-bit, there doesn't seem to be much difference, and in any case it's  the quality of the games that's important. This is the Game Boy's strength  - it has an enormous, ever-growing range of games, some of which is  excellent (the third 'Wario' game, for example, or 'R-Type DX', a faithful  recreation of 'R-Type' on a tiny screen). There are some more esoteric  applications, too, including a camera, a sonar (really), productivity  software, and a sequencer (as used on Alec Empire's 'We Punk  Einheit').As a possession, it's highly desirable - it's small, stylish  and easy to hold, and apart from the fragile battery cover, it seems very  solid. It's slightly bulkier than the Game Boy Pocket, but not  off-puttingly so, and keenly-priced, too. Only the high price of the  cartridges could put people off, but with several million Game Boys out  there (many of which are presumably restricted to playing 'Tetris' and  nothing else), there is a thriving second-hand market.\",\n",
       " \"The Game Boy Color is the best portable gaming system around. It's made all my  plane trips go by a lot faster, and for me, that makes it worth the reasonable price. There are hundreds of games out for the Game Boy Color, and many more to come. There are games in all genres, including Adventure, Arcade, Fighting, Racing, Sports, and RPG-- start your GBC Collection with Super Mario Bros. Deluxe and Tetris DX, the two classics. It's small enough to put in your jacket pocket, and the game cartridges are tiny. The only problem is that you can't play it in the dark because it isn't backlit, so you have to buy an extra light to attach onto it. But cons aside, the Game Boy Color is a great investment for hours of entertainment-- at least until summer 2001, when the Game Boy Advance comes out (which will also play Game Boy Color and Game Boy Games). But until then, I recommend the Game Boy Color to Kids and Adults alike!\",\n",

This is a good thing for some people that do not want to buy an exspensive console. The controls for the Game Boy are also very easy. Just look at the guide for your game and you will see that their are very little manuavers and they will be easy to use.Besides all of those reasons, the number one reason the Game Boy is so popular is because it is portable. Now imagine this toy that can play up to 450 games, has suberb graphics, and crisp and clear sound, can fit right in your pocket. That's Right!So, I hope you will go out (or click) for a Game Boy.

If you don't do anything really careless with it (like drop it in the toilet or hit it with a hammer, etc) it should last you many years. There are many different accessories you can get to enhance your gaming experience also.Game Boy Color is excellent, and if you haven't experienced it yet, then you should go and try it.\",\n",

In the summer of 2000,I bought Pokemon Stadium for N64 because I had just taken an interest. I did not know you needed the gameboy games(pretty stupid of me,eh?). So we bought me a kiwi colored gameboy color(too bad they had no berry color,but kiwi is just as pretty!). Along with it,I gotmy first game,Pokemon Yellow. And boy was it more than I expected. I played it hours on end! I could not put it down! I took it everywhere,in the car,resterants,grandparents',etc etc etc. It really spiced upmy summer. I kept on sticking to Pokemon games but soon I discovered more great games such as Zelda and Harvest Moon plus tins of others. I even think I enjoy it more than any other console I own(me and my brother practicly own all the systems(gamecube,PS2,dreamcast,n64,etc,etc). The batteries last a good 20 hours or so too,which is great for traveling. Yes,the gameboy advance may be out there too,and i bought one of those,but I almost think that I enjoy this more. I think gameboy color games seem to be more addicting and there are a lot more out at the present.I think the gameboy color is cooler looking than the GBA! Another great feature is that you can plug headphones in so you can play with sound without disturbing other people. I have recently broke my poor kiwi gameboy by accidently dropping it on the floor.Well,I guess we must get another one. Just make sure not to drop it because the LCD screen can get messed up. i would recommend this to anybody wholoves video game and for ANY age! This will be fun for yers to come!!\",\n",

Buy this system and pick up Game Boy camera with it too!!!',\n",

The graphics, really depending on the game, though, are great, and the colors go well together, not clashing on screen or distracting you from hours of entertainment.

I recommend you buy it, it is leaps and bounds ahead of the traditional Game Boy, and the same size as the Game Boy Pocket.',\n",

       " \"Game Boy Color is absolutely a must-have if you want a portable video game console! It is great. The things I like about it are that there are many different types of games like action, sports, racing, puzzle, adventure, and more! I also like the graphics when you are playing the games, even though the screen is very small, you still get a lot of detail. And I like the fact that the screen is in color. There is even a jack where you can plug in a little light so if you are playing in the dark, you can see what you are doing. Some of the best games on Game Boy Color are Monopoly, Ken Griffey Jr.'s Slugfest, All Star Baseball 2000, Pokemon Pinball and Tetris DX. I also like the fact that there is a very wide selection of games to choose from, which makes for more variety. Overall, if you want a good portable video game console, Game Boy Color is the one to beat! Thank you for reading my review. I hope it helped.\",\n",
       " \"Although the Game Boy Advance is on the way, the original Game Boy (here in 'Colour' form) is still going strong, and is still the only mainstream  hand-held console.Compared with the sadly-missed Neo Geo Pocket the  screen is slightly less vibrant, and sorely needs a backlight (although  adding one would decimate the battery life). Technically, although the NGP  was 16-bit, there doesn't seem to be much difference, and in any case it's  the quality of the games that's important. This is the Game Boy's strength  - it has an enormous, ever-growing range of games, some of which is  excellent (the third 'Wario' game, for example, or 'R-Type DX', a faithful  recreation of 'R-Type' on a tiny screen). There are some more esoteric  applications, too, including a camera, a sonar (really), productivity  software, and a sequencer (as used on Alec Empire's 'We Punk  Einheit').As a possession, it's highly desirable - it's small, stylish  and easy to hold, and apart from the fragile battery cover, it seems very  solid. It's slightly bulkier than the Game Boy Pocket, but not  off-puttingly so, and keenly-priced, too. Only the high price of the  cartridges could put people off, but with several million Game Boys out  there (many of which are presumably restricted to playing 'Tetris' and  nothing else), there is a thriving second-hand market.\",\n",
       " \"The Game Boy Color is the best portable gaming system around. It's made all my  plane trips go by a lot faster, and for me, that makes it worth the reasonable price. There are hundreds of games out for the Game Boy Color, and many more to come. There are games in all genres, including Adventure, Arcade, Fighting, Racing, Sports, and RPG-- start your GBC Collection with Super Mario Bros. Deluxe and Tetris DX, the two classics. It's small enough to put in your jacket pocket, and the game cartridges are tiny. The only problem is that you can't play it in the dark because it isn't backlit, so you have to buy an extra light to attach onto it. But cons aside, the Game Boy Color is a great investment for hours of entertainment-- at least until summer 2001, when the Game Boy Advance comes out (which will also play Game Boy Color and Game Boy Games). But until then, I recommend the Game Boy Color to Kids and Adults alike!\",\n",

       " \"The Game Boy was a gloriously fantastic handheld back in the day. Things couldn't have been better for Nintendo....until 1998. That's when things went up a notch for the Game Boy line. People don't want light. People don't want thin copies of the system....okay maybe they still wanna fit it in their pockets, but what the people were asking for...is color.The Game Boy Color lets you play all of your Game Boy favorites in random color, but it also opens the door into a new colorful library of games! The Game Boy Color has continued the life span of the original system to 2002.It also saves batteries, as it uses half the amount of batteries the Game Boy uses.\",\n",
       " \"I just bought a kiwi colored Game Boy and it is great! It can play over 400 games and all in color. Nintendo did a brilliant job with this portable video game platform. The graphics for most of the games rock and the sound is loud and clear (something that wasn't really great with older Game Boy models).A great thing about the Game Boy is that a lot of the games for N64 and other consoles can be found for this. This is a good thing for some people that do not want to buy an exspensive console. The controls for the Game Boy are also very easy. Just look at the guide for your game and you will see that their are very little manuavers and they will be easy to use.Besides all of those reasons, the number one reason the Game Boy is so popular is because it is portable. Now imagine this toy that can play up to 450 games, has suberb graphics, and crisp and clear sound, can fit right in your pocket. That's Right!So, I hope you will go out (or click) for a Game Boy. They are truly great things to own for a child, teen, or even an adult. They make great toys and are not that costly. Buy and enjoy.HAPPY GAMING~!\",\n",

Like, if I turn the sound circle thing all the way to the max, its less sound then it was at a little before that point. But something I like is it has a headphone jack in it, which the GBA SP Lite does not. I'm not sure if the original SP did or not, but I like using my earphones when I play a game, so thats a major plus for me. Also, I did loose the back at one point but we bought a different back at a flea market, and it fit just fine.

Solo player itself was quite challenging, and still is.

Also, there are a lot of extremely dark areas of maps that make it hard to see (maybe even impossible).  At the time of its release I thought the graphics were great, but now that I play through it again, they are kind of disappointing.  I mean, still decent for the time but considering similar games that were on the 64...they could have done a bit better.Good points: Weapons are awesome.  SMGs, plasma canon that evaporates everything in its path, pipe bombs, shrink ray allowing you to crush your enemy, expand ray that enlarges them until they explode...HA just coolness.  Combat boosts were always a neat item that I wish had been in more games.  You can also aquire a jetpack, Vitamin X, holoduke to confuse enemies, dumdum (explosive) pistol rounds, and many other helpful items.Fairly smart enemies and a wide variety of aliens.  Challenging bosses as well.A lot of objectives on each map.  Rescue the hidden \"babes\", find keycards, solve lock puzzles, even crush toilets and drink the water to regain health.

But if you are wanting a vintage gem pick up this game!  I stayed up countless nights with friends playing through the game in co-op mode and facing off with each other in team death match.  Solo player itself was quite challenging, and still is.  I have always felt this game sort of set the stage for FPS along with Perfect Dark and Golden Eye.Bad points:  It can be irritating because it is so challenging.  Also, there are a lot of extremely dark areas of maps that make it hard to see (maybe even impossible).  At the time of its release I thought the graphics were great, but now that I play through it again, they are kind of disappointing.  I mean, still decent for the time but considering similar games that were on the 64...they could have done a bit better.Good points: Weapons are awesome.  SMGs, plasma canon that evaporates everything in its path, pipe bombs, shrink ray allowing you to crush your enemy, expand ray that enlarges them until they explode...HA just coolness.  Combat boosts were always a neat item that I wish had been in more games.  You can also aquire a jetpack, Vitamin X, holoduke to confuse enemies, dumdum (explosive) pistol rounds, and many other helpful items.Fairly smart enemies and a wide variety of aliens.  Challenging bosses as well.A lot of objectives on each map.  Rescue the hidden \"babes\", find keycards, solve lock puzzles, even crush toilets and drink the water to regain health.  And you get a good number of maps too!I would suggest picking this game up, you get a lot of play time out of it.  Its a good blast from the past for us who miss the N64 on occassion.',\n",
       " \"This is one of the best shoot 'em ups on the 64. This game is pretty much the same as the PC version, but with more levels, extended levels / or added bits and peices, and a few new toys.It pretty much feels just like the PC version but it's a little darker on the graphics. You will have to run trough the game control settings to find the right feel for you if you're like me and where used to using the keyboard.Most of the cool stuff is still there from the PC game. There is the same sayings, some new ones, same levels etc.. whats missing is the adult content the PC had packed into it. So some things are different like, there is no strippers dancing around, and you can't go up and press OPEN to throw them money, and the posters are different etc... infact the second levels strip club has been completly re decorated into an out-door loading dock with trucks. Thats a bit of a disapointment that that stuff was replaced to tone it down.There is some new toys to play with, but overall, there isnt enough weaopens. There is a hand gun, shot gun, machine gun, plasma shooter, grenade thrower, shrinkin ray, enlarging ray (new weopen! enlrage youre enemy till the explode!) and a few other ones. But compared to something like Goldeneye, there feels like harldy any guns to choose from.I used to love to use cheats on the PC version, and with this 64 version, there are a couple of cheats, but there's none to walk through walls which I do miss.(...)it's pretty hard to stay alive, so turn the god mode on and enjoy it.\",\n",
       " \"This game is the best! 4 people OR 4 DukeBots (computer controlled multiplayer opponents, hella cool) to challenge in multiplayer, each higher difficulty meaning more bodies flying in the air(you can have ppl and dukebots play at the same time), 2 player co-op, and one heck of a single player experiance. Who wouldn't want to save babes while bustin in a movie theater shooting alien scum all over the place? Pig cop with a shotgun? Introduce him, to your grenade launcher, BattleLord giving you a hard time??? throw him a pipe bomb party! Your options of fighting opponents are endless with dukes arsenal of guns ranging from shotguns, sub machine guns, grenade launchers, missle launchers all the way to trip mines(great in multiplayer), and shrink guns which allows you to shrink your opponents and crush like a bug with your 15 size boot. The guns are the best yet in an fps. The gameplay is hot as well, your environment is your playground, use toilets, blow up toilets, bust open a movie screen in the theatres, discover cool secrets by blowing open walls, PLAY POOL, the list goes on. Bust open aliens as you make your way saving babes, searching for key cards, finding hot new weapons, and having one helluva time. Do you have what it takes to save earth from aliens, can duke save his babes before aliens use them for mass production (weird, I know), always bet on Duke. Are you bored of my review and eager to get this game??? STOP READING THE THING AND GET DUKE NUKEM 64!!\",\n",

       " \"The first SML game sold so well that Nintendo went back to the drawing board and came up with the sequel. In 1992, Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins was released for the Game Boy and was also a smash hit. Mario returns in  the sequel that blends in elements of Super Mario Bros, captures the feel of Super Mario Bros 3 (classic NES game) and introduces a brand new villain, Wario (now a fan favorite and well known Nintendo character.) It's a great game that belonged in anyone's Game Boy collection.In Super Mario Land 2, Wario comes out of nowhere and kicks out Mario from his castle and takes over his land. To face him, Mario must collect 6 coins scattered throughout 6 worlds with multiple levels each in order to regain his castle. The same rules applies just like in Super Mario Land and with more enemies, power ups and stages to see, the game saves your progress after you complete each level.The PROS: SML 2 is better than SML in every way possible. The graphics are improved, new music tracks are here and they sound great. The sound effects are on point and so are the controls. The game is longer now and since it has battery backed memory, you no longer have to beat it in one sitting. Plus, the game feels like an alternate version of Super Mario Bros 3, which was a great game so it can only help in the long run.The CONS: Just like Super Mario Land, SML 2 is not that hard so gamers had no problems completing the game. They just took a little longer doing so but it was all in fun.The sequel was a bigger and better game and thanks to Nintendo, they delivered a fun game that made lots of great memories. I still have the original cartridge and I still get a kick playing this game every once in a while. For those who are still on the fence, Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins is worth tracking down if you have a Game Boy or Game Boy Advance SP handheld that still works.\",\n",
       " 'The Game \"Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins\" was probably the first game I received when I got my Gameboy somewhere between 1992-1993. I swear when I first got this game, I couldn\\'t put it down for hours. The game was hard at first, but as you gain experience, it gets easier and easier (I might have beaten the game about 100 times now).There are 6 different levels in this game, Space Zone, Pumpkin Zone, Mario Zone, Turtle Zone, Tree Zone, & Marco Zone which signifies the 6 golden coins concept. I\\'d say the hardest is the Space Zone (that took me a long time to beat at first), before you get to Wario\\'s Castle. Some of the bosses are easy to beat also.

Each of these sections has a few levels, complete with a boss. The great thing about this game is the diversity, rather than Super Mario World which recycled the same background graphics in each level, Super Mario Land 2, each level has a different theme, like being in a bee hive, underground, a haunted house, a witches workshop, a lake, the moon and so on. There is no multi-player mode. It's a fun game, with all of the new enemies and challenges, and there are two exits to each level, a normal exit and an exit that leads to a bonus round with one of 2 games (crane game or a mouse hunt game) for items and 1-Ups.

       " \"The original Super Mario Land was a great game, but it was strange. Super Mario Land 2, while the setting is stranger, sticks closer to the Mario series' splendid gameplay. Along with the Mario Galaxy games, however, this game shows how far Nintendo can be creative with the designs.It turns out that Wario distracted Mario in the first game by sending alien Tatanga to kidnap Daisy. So, he's the main bad guy, whereas Tatanga serves as a boss in the space world. Space world? Yup, there are 6 different worlds, and all of them have really weird settings. EXAMPLES: Macro Zone pits Mario into a giant house. Mario Zone is actually a factory that, on the outside, is shaped like the plucky plumber.Although the settings are weird, that actually allows Nintendo to push the company's creativity to their furthest. I mean, seriously, Mario is seen SWIMMING IN WATER that is ATTACHED TO THE CEILING! Not to mention, he can also run across giant Lego blocks, float in space, and fight actual sharks! Never would we have known that Mario would be able to go outside the Mushroom Kingdom by this much.This game is the Super Mario World of Game Boy games, and that's saying a lot. The main gameplay is what you would normally expect. You can run, jump, stomp enemies, bash blocks, and spin jump your way through about 25 nicely detailed levels. The main power-ups are, as you expect, the Mushroom and the Fire Flower. Yes, that's right. The SuperBall flower that was in the first game got replaced by the return of the Fire Flower. Not only that, but there's also the Bunny Hat, which allows Mario to float in the air for a short period of time, similar to the Super Leaf in Super Mario Bros 3. But here, you can float longer than in Mario 3.The challenge is fair most of the time, but the problem with it is that once you get a Game Over, you lose a Golden Coin that you have been rewarded from one of the bosses you fight. So, you must go back and fight the boss again. Let's hope you don't die too many times.But overall, this is a really great game. If you're looking for a good Mario game for your Game Boy, Color, or Advance, ORDER THIS GAME NOW!\",\n",

I am 25% out of 100. ) The levels are underwater, Halloween, Legos, and more. Some enemies are saws, turtles, ghosts, witches, divers, and pigs. There is even different music when you go different places!\",\n",

       " 'The original Super Mario Land left gamers scratching the heads, but nonetheless enjoying themselves. Building off the commercial success of the first Game Boy title, Super Mario Land 2 returns to a familiar formula and manages to squeeze just about as much as you could into a Game Boy cartridge.The game has the Mario flare that we have come accustomed to as fans of the series. Platforming, underwater levels, koopas, and more show their faces throughout Mario Land. It\\'s fun for all ages, and offers about 32 levels of playtime. I will say though that up until the final level, the game is easier than community college (I had over 70 lives at the end of the game), and then all of a sudden you\\'re thrown into the final level, which has a much steeper difficulty curve than anything you\\'ve played before. The game introduces Mario\\'s nemesis, Wario, who more than capably fills the shoes of Bowser as the bad guy.Overall the game runs like a well-oiled machine, never once locking up during my experience. There\\'s a lot of entertainment to be had here, but it does get repetitious at times. Level layout is pretty basic, and event the \"secret goals\" found in certain levels aren\\'t all that difficult to figure out. The music doesn\\'t do too much for me, either. As far as original game boy games go though, Super Mario Land 2 should be in your collection, as it improves on just about every aspect of the original game.',\n",
       " \"Super Mario Land 2 is way better than its first one.  In this &quot;retro review&quot; we're going to look at what made this one of the best GB games of its time (but too bad just a year later we'd get &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Links Awakening&quot;).The graphics were a major step above the first one and were actually stunning visuals for the GB. They look ALMOST like a snazzy early SNES game.Gameplay actually very closely resembles Super Mario Bros. 3 and Super Mario World.  You've got your power ups that unlike the first Super Mario Land can actually TELL you grabbed them.  The Flower Power up and the Bunny Ears (only seen in this one) are nice.  The Bunny Ears is like the leaf in SMB3. Except that Mario can't fly but they allow him to glide down to safety.The music is great for its time and even now it isn't bad.  It's been about 11 years since its release and the tunes still play out in my head at times.The Map is used in this one as well.  Except you can't go and challenge old bosses which kind of stinks.The story follows that Mario has lost his castle to Wario (no saving Princess Daisy in this one) and he can only get back into his castel using the six golden coins so he must set out to find them in one of the six different &quot;Zones.&quot;  What's nice about this is that you aren't forced to take the zones in any specific order at all!  What's not to like about that.  However, if you get a game over you have to find all six coins again.For those whinning about no saving on Super Mario Land you can finally stop your bitchin' because this game incorporates an auto-save feature.  It works well but there are moments where the game will erase the data on its own.Overall this is still a worthwhile game even so many years later.  Grab this game if you can and see what happens!\",\n",
       " \"The first SML game sold so well that Nintendo went back to the drawing board and came up with the sequel. In 1992, Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins was released for the Game Boy and was also a smash hit. Mario returns in  the sequel that blends in elements of Super Mario Bros, captures the feel of Super Mario Bros 3 (classic NES game) and introduces a brand new villain, Wario (now a fan favorite and well known Nintendo character.) It's a great game that belonged in anyone's Game Boy collection.In Super Mario Land 2, Wario comes out of nowhere and kicks out Mario from his castle and takes over his land. To face him, Mario must collect 6 coins scattered throughout 6 worlds with multiple levels each in order to regain his castle. The same rules applies just like in Super Mario Land and with more enemies, power ups and stages to see, the game saves your progress after you complete each level.The PROS: SML 2 is better than SML in every way possible. The graphics are improved, new music tracks are here and they sound great. The sound effects are on point and so are the controls. The game is longer now and since it has battery backed memory, you no longer have to beat it in one sitting. Plus, the game feels like an alternate version of Super Mario Bros 3, which was a great game so it can only help in the long run.The CONS: Just like Super Mario Land, SML 2 is not that hard so gamers had no problems completing the game. They just took a little longer doing so but it was all in fun.The sequel was a bigger and better game and thanks to Nintendo, they delivered a fun game that made lots of great memories. I still have the original cartridge and I still get a kick playing this game every once in a while. For those who are still on the fence, Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins is worth tracking down if you have a Game Boy or Game Boy Advance SP handheld that still works.\",\n",

I\\'d say the hardest is the Space Zone (that took me a long time to beat at first), before you get to Wario\\'s Castle. Some of the bosses are easy to beat also. There are also hidden stages in this game to find, and when you beat them the zone setting will change (like in the Tree Zone, you will see flowers and such).Special powers aren\\'t really anything too new.

What I do like is that if you lose your Fire Flower of Rabbit Ears, you can still be big. I've beaten this game a lot, but it's still fun to do. It's a great buy.\",\n",

       " \"The original Super Mario Land was a great game, but it was strange. Super Mario Land 2, while the setting is stranger, sticks closer to the Mario series' splendid gameplay. Along with the Mario Galaxy games, however, this game shows how far Nintendo can be creative with the designs.It turns out that Wario distracted Mario in the first game by sending alien Tatanga to kidnap Daisy. So, he's the main bad guy, whereas Tatanga serves as a boss in the space world. Space world? Yup, there are 6 different worlds, and all of them have really weird settings. EXAMPLES: Macro Zone pits Mario into a giant house. Mario Zone is actually a factory that, on the outside, is shaped like the plucky plumber.Although the settings are weird, that actually allows Nintendo to push the company's creativity to their furthest. I mean, seriously, Mario is seen SWIMMING IN WATER that is ATTACHED TO THE CEILING! Not to mention, he can also run across giant Lego blocks, float in space, and fight actual sharks! Never would we have known that Mario would be able to go outside the Mushroom Kingdom by this much.This game is the Super Mario World of Game Boy games, and that's saying a lot. The main gameplay is what you would normally expect. You can run, jump, stomp enemies, bash blocks, and spin jump your way through about 25 nicely detailed levels. The main power-ups are, as you expect, the Mushroom and the Fire Flower. Yes, that's right. The SuperBall flower that was in the first game got replaced by the return of the Fire Flower. Not only that, but there's also the Bunny Hat, which allows Mario to float in the air for a short period of time, similar to the Super Leaf in Super Mario Bros 3. But here, you can float longer than in Mario 3.The challenge is fair most of the time, but the problem with it is that once you get a Game Over, you lose a Golden Coin that you have been rewarded from one of the bosses you fight. So, you must go back and fight the boss again. Let's hope you don't die too many times.But overall, this is a really great game. If you're looking for a good Mario game for your Game Boy, Color, or Advance, ORDER THIS GAME NOW!\",\n",
       " \"This game is very fun! The only thing bad about the game is that it may start out easy but it gets VERY HARD. Three people can save this game at one time. ( Better than most games. ) It also has no passwords! Good! I hate writing passwords down. There are more than 20 levels of fun. ( I only know some because I didn't complete the game. I am 25% out of 100. ) The levels are underwater, Halloween, Legos, and more. Some enemies are saws, turtles, ghosts, witches, divers, and pigs. There is even different music when you go different places!\",\n",
       " \"I think this is the best game ever for the old black and white Game Boy. The graphics are great for Game Boy there are seven different levels that you must complete to and get golden coins before entering Wario's Castle and fighting him. There are also hidden levels. You can save your game. You can save up to three different games. If you have Game Boy Color it interprets the black and white into some color pretty well. This is a great game if you see it for sale somewhere used.\",\n",
       " 'The original Super Mario Land left gamers scratching the heads, but nonetheless enjoying themselves. Building off the commercial success of the first Game Boy title, Super Mario Land 2 returns to a familiar formula and manages to squeeze just about as much as you could into a Game Boy cartridge.The game has the Mario flare that we have come accustomed to as fans of the series. Platforming, underwater levels, koopas, and more show their faces throughout Mario Land. It\\'s fun for all ages, and offers about 32 levels of playtime. I will say though that up until the final level, the game is easier than community college (I had over 70 lives at the end of the game), and then all of a sudden you\\'re thrown into the final level, which has a much steeper difficulty curve than anything you\\'ve played before. The game introduces Mario\\'s nemesis, Wario, who more than capably fills the shoes of Bowser as the bad guy.Overall the game runs like a well-oiled machine, never once locking up during my experience. There\\'s a lot of entertainment to be had here, but it does get repetitious at times. Level layout is pretty basic, and event the \"secret goals\" found in certain levels aren\\'t all that difficult to figure out. The music doesn\\'t do too much for me, either. As far as original game boy games go though, Super Mario Land 2 should be in your collection, as it improves on just about every aspect of the original game.',\n",
       " \"Super Mario Land 2 is way better than its first one.  In this &quot;retro review&quot; we're going to look at what made this one of the best GB games of its time (but too bad just a year later we'd get &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Links Awakening&quot;).The graphics were a major step above the first one and were actually stunning visuals for the GB. They look ALMOST like a snazzy early SNES game.Gameplay actually very closely resembles Super Mario Bros. 3 and Super Mario World.  You've got your power ups that unlike the first Super Mario Land can actually TELL you grabbed them.  The Flower Power up and the Bunny Ears (only seen in this one) are nice.  The Bunny Ears is like the leaf in SMB3. Except that Mario can't fly but they allow him to glide down to safety.The music is great for its time and even now it isn't bad.  It's been about 11 years since its release and the tunes still play out in my head at times.The Map is used in this one as well.  Except you can't go and challenge old bosses which kind of stinks.The story follows that Mario has lost his castle to Wario (no saving Princess Daisy in this one) and he can only get back into his castel using the six golden coins so he must set out to find them in one of the six different &quot;Zones.&quot;  What's nice about this is that you aren't forced to take the zones in any specific order at all!  What's not to like about that.  However, if you get a game over you have to find all six coins again.For those whinning about no saving on Super Mario Land you can finally stop your bitchin' because this game incorporates an auto-save feature.  It works well but there are moments where the game will erase the data on its own.Overall this is still a worthwhile game even so many years later.  Grab this game if you can and see what happens!\",\n",

Many of them are, while officially licensed and every bit bonafide canon, not made purely by Nintendo\\'s in-house development teams (for those who find this as news, most of the portable games have been developed by Capcom).

There is just that perfect balance of action, exploration, puzzle solving, and a dash of side quest that makes a Zelda game feel \"right.\" Where later portable Zelda games fall short by forcing players into poorly executed minigames, lengthy and confusing trade quests, and generally disappointing level and boss designs, Link\\'s Awakening serves up imaginative original bosses, and some rehashes of bosses from previous games, as well as dungeon levels ranging from short and simple to surprisingly complex (yet still fun and manageable!). And like any good Zelda game, the difficulty level is right in the ball park of being just challenging enough that you may die a few times, but not so confusing as to make you throw the game aside while you frustratedly search a walkthrough for help.As is to be expected of a portable Zelda game, there\\'s no actual Zelda character involved and the Triforce are nowhere to be seen, but for some of us, that\\'s somewhat refreshing. Your ultimate goal in the game is to collect several magical instruments (a theme now found in many Zelda games) and solve the mystery of how Link ended up on the mysterious Koholint Island.I like to consider Link\\'s Awakening the last true Legend of Zelda game, since every Zelda game after it has been either in full 3D or has been some Capcom mess that just doesn\\'t quite hit the nail on the head. If your favorite Zelda games are the Oracle pair, Minish Cap, Majora\\'s Mask or the Windwaker/Phantom Hourglass games, this may not be for you, but for recent fans or long-time Zelda fans looking for a return to the roots of the Zelda series without being tied down to a console, this is undoubtedly the best choice.',\n",

And hot off the success of the NES Mario games, Nintendo released Super Mario Land soon after and it sold very well. While the game itself is short compared to the NES games, Mario's first SMB inspired game was still good enough to pick up and play.Super Mario Land took the same game play mechanics of Super Mario Bros for the NES, added a few familiar enemies while bringing in new ones, changed some power ups and introduced a new princess to rescue. As Mario, you stomp on enemies, collect power ups and coins through 4 worlds each with 4 levels. To switch things up, you control an airplane and a submarine on a few stages and this time Bowser isn't the main villain you're after.The PROS: It was a dream come true for many Game Boy owners: the chance to play a portable Mario game and it was good too. For its time, the graphics and sounds were what you expected in a Mario game while the music was in a class all its own. The fact that it was similar to Super Mario Bros yet it had its own feel was different and that was a good thing.The CONS: While the game was good, you can't help to think that just when you were getting into the game, it's over. It was because it was super short compared to Super Mario Bros. And just like the NES game, you had to beat the game in one shot without any password system or battery backed save progress to mark your progress.Despite its flaw, the game had a charm all its own and featured Nintendo's famous mascot at the time. It was a good game and you could have taken it everywhere with you.

All you get is the mushroom and the fire flower. And when you get hit, you\\'ll turn back small (not Super Mario like most games). Also some of the enemies are very difficult to beat and takes a while to kill. And at times, some levels are too difficult to beat (Like the third level [Easter Island]), so it gets real fustrating. I managed to beat the game, and I believe it stats me over from the beginning and it is much harder to play.Basically this game is alomst exactly like the first Super Mario that was on Nintendo, but just shorter.

       " \"I can't believe I got this game for Christmas fourteen years ago.  For months after, I would actually *dream* this game.Now, for original Game Boy, it's no masterpiece like Metroid II, Tetris, or Link's Awakening.  But Super Mario Land is, however, a fine jumping-stomping-smashing-fireball-spitting Mario game, and one of the first and best games available for that giant grey plastic box of yore.While the &quot;save&quot; problem is annoying to me as a gamer now, I'd never even heard of &quot;saving&quot; and &quot;restoring&quot; when I got this game as a kid.  It just wasn't done back then.  It was no different from playing Mario Bros. on Nintendo to me.Once you get past the charmingly crude graphics (that's why we call it a &quot;digital antique&quot;), the sound and gameplay are enough to keep you occupied.  Quality Mario action.  3 1/2 stars.\",\n",
       " \"On August 1989 when Gameboy was released around the world mainly the US and Japan, Nintendo decided that a new Mario adventure to go with it would be a perfect match in heaven. They succeeded! this game has often been considered to be as odd as Super Mario Brothers 2 was at the time but this one felt more like the original Super Mario Brothers games.Here Luigi is not required for this is Mario's solo adventure! In this game you are not in the Mushroom kingdom or the dream world of Subcon, instead you are in a weird place called Sarasaland where a new princess named Daisy was kidnapped by an alien named Tatanga. Here in this game you do 12 levels in 4 worlds as you fight goombas, Koopas with bombs instead of shells, Chinese ghosts, Moai statue heads that attack and more bizarre stuff.It's a fresh and different Mario adventure just like the last year's Super Mario Bros. 2 game only more true to the original Super Mario Bros. formula of the first game. What's cool in this game you get a special flower that grants you a special ball that defeats enemies and collects coins for you, there's also different enemies to fight such as killer Sphinxes to giant Sea-Horses as in 2 levels it can become a sidescroller where your in a Sub or plane blasting enemies including bosses which makes this a worthwhile Mario game.The graphics are simplistic yet primitive and small for the gameboy but works well on Super GameBoy for the SNES. If you can find this at a flea market, Pawn-Shop or Online then you'll be surprised on how well this holds up as i do believe the sequels are even better.\",\n",
       " \"Mario is off to another adventure to save the great Princess Daisy, first Mario has to zoom through 11 action packed levels to find that the real princess daisy is in the 12th and last level of this game. Mario rescues Daisy and with a happy ending Mario and Daisy get back to the Mushroom Kingdom!This is a Wonderful Game probably my all time favorite game boy game, this was the first game boy game I played, I first tried it when I was 4 and then I beat it about 25 times when I was 9 and I am a teenager now and still love this game very much. I still play the game everyday and beat it very fast. When I was 9 I could complete the whole game in 15 minutes due to many shortcuts I found:) Get the Original Game Boy with Super Mario Land and lay off the chocolate milk while buying a Nintendo DS Lite. All of the Super Mario Land Games+ the original tetris is SO MUCH better than a Nintendo DS where the games are the size of your finger nail and cost $35.00, please agree with me on this one, I still have a loaded wallet and bought 30 games the other day! I got this one for $1.50 at Game Stop because it was $9.99 -75% and then I had my edge card so -10% and I got it for $1.50, if you want to save money please write this down when buying Game Boy Games:Tell them: I have an EDGE Card Number, could you please use it and then give them the number it is 10% off-006904068118 EXP: 7/09Please use it because I have barely used it, it just saves 10% it isn't money to me, it cost $15.00 for a year and you get 1 magazine each month. PLEASE GET THIS GAME! THIS is the best game you will have ever bought, the fact it doesn't save just adds a big bar of replay value to this game, it is the most replayable game I have ever played:) and that is out of a lot, a few hundred games..... Do yourselves a favor and lay back on the couch and enjoy Mario's first adventure on the game boy!Thanks!J.R. Platt\",\n",
       " 'As I said in the title, this game is very fun, but it is short and easy.  I had never played this game before so when I got it I popped it into my GBA SP and to my surprise, I beat it in about 90 minutes.  Here are some specifics.  This game has 4 worlds and each world has 3 stages.  As opposed to Super Mario Bros. on the NES which has 8 worlds and each world has 4 stages.  In stage 3 of worlds 2 and 4, Mario is in a old style plane and the game becomes a shooter game.  The jumping controls are a bit odd if you are not used to them, because Mario lingers in the air for a bit before he comes down.  When you stomp you the koopas, you better get out of the way because their shells explode after a couple seconds.  At the end of each stage, instead of a flagpole, there are 2 doors you can go into.  One at the top of the screen and one at the bottom.  If you make it into the one at the top of the screen, you get a bonus game where you can get up to 3 extra lives or a fire flower.  Plus there are still bonus areas when you go into pipes and for some of them, there is an insane amount of coins.  Overall, this is a very fun game with a lot of replay value.',\n",
       " 'Personally, I really like this game. Released around the Game Boy\\'s very first launch, Super Mario Land assisted the Game Boy sales, and Super Mario Land also kept selling for at least 7 years thanks to the sales and loyal fans that are just as great as this game. I won\\'t bash the graphics, because \"What did you expect? 1080p or 3D in Game Boy games back then?\" Now, the Nintendo 3DS keeps Super Mario Land alive via the Virtual Console for 3DS. The music is great and the gameplay is cool. If you have up to 30-45 minutes of free time, play this game to keep you entertained! Fun fact: Did you know that this game was originally intended to be bundled with the Game Boy? Yes, according to someone from a You Tube video[...] , a gentleman named Hank Rogers from Bullet-proof Software said: \"If you wanted to sell the Game Boy to kids, pack in (Super) Mario Land. If you want to sell it to everyone, pack in Tetris.\"',\n",
       " \"Much like the first NES Mario game, this first Mario game for the Gameboy is very basic, both in graphics and gameplay. It was one of Gameboy's first games, and is a definite classic. The bad guy in here is Tatanga, and I only wish that there had been more of him - Princess Daisy has become a regular character in the Mario universe, but Tatanga has all but disappeared from memory.\",\n",
       " 'Game was in good shape, and it made my son very happy, when he received it. It was over all a good experience. Thank You',\n",
       " 'Originally reviewed at Last-Gen.com:The Nintendo Game Boy was a huge success thanks to AAA titles like Super Mario Land to boost sales at launch on 1989. The first-ever Mario platformer on a handheld, it is a faithful-yet-quirky game that\\'s a trip down memory lane.While video games at home were getting much more sophisticated by 1989, handhelds were still in its infancy. Mario had already been a household name by then thanks to Super Mario Bros. on the NES, and Mario was exactly what the budding Game Boy needed to succeed.Familiar characters and gameplay welcome the player without much of a learning curve, but there are some distinct differences. While the NES counterpart had castles as their main theme, Mario this time around travels to Egypt, China, and even another planet. Goombas and Piranha Plants make a comeback along with the upgraded Koopa Troopas, who now explode upon getting stepped on. Other enemies include aliens, sphinxes, and Chinese ghosts. There are also a couple side-scrolling shooter type levels that keep the game interesting.The music was memorable and catchy, very fitting for the levels. The ending theme is also nice, but it doesn\\'t feel very \"Mario.\" I also didn\\'t feel that the game ended on a positive note, as the last level was a side-scrolling shooter -- not a very \"Mario\" way to wrap up a game. As with most Mario games at this era, the story is transparent as usual. The level designs are still creative and fun to play, but game is short with only 4 worlds with 4 levels each -- it\\'s to be expected since there\\'s no saving feature (run out of AA batteries and you\\'re starting over). Also not so surprising is the lack of a 2-player option.Super Mario Land definitely shows its age, but it\\'s still a very fun game to play. It may only take you one sitting to beat, but the current cheap prices for the game should merit a purchase for the Mario fan.',\n",
       " \"I still remember that I bought this game along with the GameBoy when they were released in 1989 when I was still a teenager. It has everything a Mario fan could expect! Graphics are very similar to Super Mario Bro. for the NES as well as the gameplay and no saving feature! In addition, there are some new elements like divided road at the end of a stage and could ride an airplane in the sky or a submarine in the deep ocean. That's is why this game is one of my favorites of all time!\",\n",
       " \"Super Mario Land is a classic Mario game and one of the first games for the then-new Game Boy. It features the great gameplay that hailed from Super Mario Bros, although few physics are a little bit off. The graphics and sounds were greatly-developed, especially the music.SML is one of the few games that prove that even the game with the smallest length can succeed. There's only 12 levels, not counting the harder quest (Yup. This game has a harder quest like in SMB).Also, Mario Land may be fun and all, but who knew it was so strange?There's no Bowser, Peach, or even the Mushroom Kingdom, but instead, you romp through Egypt, chasing an alien named Tatanga who has captured Daisy. And that's just the setting. In-game, there are Koopas with bombs for shells, robots, and when you go to World 4, it turns out that world takes place in Japan, as hinted by the music! The Fire Flower isn't even a Fire Flower. Instead, you get to shoot Superballs, which are rubber version of fireballs that can bounce off walls.Despite all that strangeness, it's pure Mario action in the palm of your hand.\",\n",
       " \"Alright, I know there are those with the gripes (can't save, only 12 levels, blah blah blah) but this game is pretty old guys. This game was released in 1989 and there weren't very many games back then that you actually could save on.  Second, there are only 12 levels and they're extremely short. You can beat the game in simply 30 minutes. There should be no reason why anyone should have to save at all.  It's very easy to rack up several lives thanks to the bonus game that Nintendo threw in as well.For 1989 and for the early years of the Gameboy these graphics aren't bad.  While they look like something seen on a graphing calculator they're not bad considering its age.The game isn't too hard, but it isn't so easy either.  The gameplay is similar to the original Mario Bros. on the NES.  Except that you can't tell which power up you've got.  That could be a problem.The game can be played by just about anyone.  Sure you can't save but you've got to remember the games AGE!  Saving wouldn't become a norm until the early 90's in the day and age of the SNES.\",\n",
       " \"I've always had fond memories of this game from my childhood, so I decided to purchase it to play again on those long flights home. It's just as I remember. The game is a lot of fun and the music just sticks in your head. The only problem with the game is you can't save.\",\n",
       " \"I'm being a bit generous giving it four stars. The game is... certainly a change of pace from other Mario games. However, if you can look past that (and the slippery controls while I'm at it) it's pretty good.\",\n",
       " \"Yes, this game is way old. It still hold us extremely well though. Playing the old monochrome games on the Sp causes them to almost upgrade. This game still looks great and control well. Its just old school Mario 2D goodness. The cool thing and reason I bout this is that it has enemies that Mario faces that he doesn't face in any other game to date. Its a great title to own to play or just collect.\",\n",
       " \"This is a fun game that you will find yourself coming back to multiple times. It's not terribly long (in fact, a seasoned player will be able to beat it in less than half an hour) but what's in it is entertaining and gives you that child-like sense of wonder we all long for when playing our favorite.  Definitely recommend this game to anybody who loves Mario or Nintendo!\",\n",
       " \"Don't be fooled by this game's relatively crude graphics. Since this is a first-generation Gameboy game, I can let that slide. The music and sound f/x are good for the GB, but what makes this game shine is the gameplay...classic Super Mario gameplay with some new ideas (traveling via submarine and airplane). The last fight (the one with Tatanga) is more of a shooter, but still this is a very fun game. A word of advice...do NOT be fooled by the crude graphics! This game is a blast!\",\n",
       " \"Super Mario Land was really great. You are Mario and you search through worlds to try to find Princess Daisy. It's a great game because I hate Bowser and Bowser isn't in this game. The only problem is.... no saving!! Oh,well.\",\n",
       " \"When the Game Boy was released in 1989, fans everywhere went to buy it in droves and along came some very good games for the handheld system. And hot off the success of the NES Mario games, Nintendo released Super Mario Land soon after and it sold very well. While the game itself is short compared to the NES games, Mario's first SMB inspired game was still good enough to pick up and play.Super Mario Land took the same game play mechanics of Super Mario Bros for the NES, added a few familiar enemies while bringing in new ones, changed some power ups and introduced a new princess to rescue. As Mario, you stomp on enemies, collect power ups and coins through 4 worlds each with 4 levels. To switch things up, you control an airplane and a submarine on a few stages and this time Bowser isn't the main villain you're after.The PROS: It was a dream come true for many Game Boy owners: the chance to play a portable Mario game and it was good too. For its time, the graphics and sounds were what you expected in a Mario game while the music was in a class all its own. The fact that it was similar to Super Mario Bros yet it had its own feel was different and that was a good thing.The CONS: While the game was good, you can't help to think that just when you were getting into the game, it's over. It was because it was super short compared to Super Mario Bros. And just like the NES game, you had to beat the game in one shot without any password system or battery backed save progress to mark your progress.Despite its flaw, the game had a charm all its own and featured Nintendo's famous mascot at the time. It was a good game and you could have taken it everywhere with you. It's definitely brought me some fond memories and if you get the chance to play it and you haven't played it before, you won't regret it.\",\n",
       " 'After my success of \"Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins\", I decided to play the first \"Super Mario Land\". To me this game is okay, but nothing too exciting to write home about. It\\'s basically like playing the first Super Mario game back when it was on Nintendo. There are four levels to beat, and each end of the level has a boss to beat.The super powers are origonal. All you get is the mushroom and the fire flower. And when you get hit, you\\'ll turn back small (not Super Mario like most games). Also some of the enemies are very difficult to beat and takes a while to kill. And at times, some levels are too difficult to beat (Like the third level [Easter Island]), so it gets real fustrating. I managed to beat the game, and I believe it stats me over from the beginning and it is much harder to play.Basically this game is alomst exactly like the first Super Mario that was on Nintendo, but just shorter. If you liked that game, then give this one a try.',\n",

      "This is one of the best games!  You have to play it.  It is definitely the best game in the Zelda series so far.  It has adventure, romance, mystery, and SO many subquests.  It's about a boy named Link who has a destiny.  He lives in Kokiri Village, a little tiny village in the land of Hyrule.  Anyway, a little fairy named Navi comes and says that he must meet the Deku Tree.  He does and the Deku Tree tells him to go inside the Deku Tree and destroy all of the evil monsters inside him.  Link does this and the Deku Tree gives him the Kokiri Emerald, or the Spiritual Stone of Forest.  The Deku Tree phrophesies that Ganondorf, an evil desert Gerudo man, is trying to get hold of the Triforce, the essence of life in Hyrule.  But in order to get hold of the Triforce you have to get three of the spiritual stones.  Unfortuantely, after the tree's prophecy, he died because of the curse Ganondorf had cast upon him.  But Link and Navi go on their journey and get the Goron's Ruby, or Spiritual Stone of Fire and the Zora's Sapphire, or Spiritual Stone of Water.  Link gets the Ocarina of Time but when he opens the doors Ganondorf gets in before him and he gets the Triforce.  Link waits seven years in the Chamber of Time and when he awakes he's all grown up.  Rauru, the Sage of Light is there and tells him that he must save all the Sages from their temples and receive the medallions.  He receives the Medallion of Light, Forest, Fire, Water, Shadow, and Spirit.  But the game.  It's definitely one of the best N64 games around!\n",

      "Ok I am continuing my reviews for The Zelda games I own cause I don't own every Zelda game. This Zelda game is without a doubt favorite Legend Of Zelda A Link To The Past Which for any of those who don't know was suppose to be called Zelda III The Triforce Saga. But since The NES was near the end of it's life span Nintendo decided to go for The SNES. If any game deserves the title of Zelda III cause I think of the 1st 2 Zelda games on The NES & A Link To The Past as a Triforce Saga. Now after Zelda II wasn't what everybody wanted even though I didn't mind it they decided to go back to an overhead view & drop The RPG elements go back to using Rupee's & weapons instead of using all magic attacks. If I could give this game all the stars in the world I would if I am a fanboy for this game then color me a fanboy. I played this game a lot along with Mario All Stars & Street Fighter II Turbo back in the day. Even now hearing about all the glitches & preforming them this game is feels fresh & this game is 21 years old. This game brings a lot to the table like the tone which would be used in Ocarina Of Time & big time in Majora's Mask as well for Twilight Princess. This game started the dark tone in a Zelda games. You have this character Aghnim he not only collects the money from The King for helping him he then kills The King & takes these Maidens that are ancestors to The Wise Men he seals them into The Dark World. The Dark World is the land where The Triforce is at people who go to The Dark World don't come back & they change shape. It's a twisted version of Hyrule. Link is framed by Aghnim a kid gets sick from the evil air coming from Death Mountain. You have this kid who plays the flute who is dead. The next reviews I do for The Zelda games will go more in depth this game was released in Japan in 1991 & a few months later in The Spring of 92 The name of this game in Japan is The Legend Of Zelda The Triforce Of The Gods. The story is Ganon tries to get his hands on The Triforce he enters The Golden Land The King has 7 Wise Men put a seal on the enterance to The Golden Land which it seems that he's been sealed there forever. Hundreds of years later a drought a famine & illnesses have spread through Hyrule The King thought it had something to do with The Golden Land but the seal was intact a Wizard or a Satanic Priest however you want to look at I prefer what Aghnim was in The Japanese version. Aghnim shows up & ends the problems with Hyrule, The King was looking for decendents of The 7 Wise Men Aghnim helped him find them then he got a big role in The Kingdom Aghnim's intentions came clear he murdered The King Of Hyrule put a mind control spell on The Guards had The Maidens rounded up & sent them to The Dark World which this is all told in the opening & it really showed off the power of The SNES plus that music by Koji Kondo is great which ALTTP is my favorite Zelda score Ocarina Of Time is 2nd the opening music where it shows Aghnim sending The Madiens to The Dark World scared me as a kid.[...]Princess Zelda is locked up she sends out a telepathic message 1 of the people who get it is Link & this is not The same Link from the 1st 2 games & this is not the Zelda you save from the 1st game or the sleeping Zelda from part II. Link's Uncle decides he's going to see what that Aghnim guy is up to he tells Link not to leave the house. Well he does anyway you head for The Castle & find a secret passageway where you find your Uncle has been badly injured he gives you his sword & shield he never finish'e his sentence & there is a lot of debate about what he wants to say he says Princess Zelda is your a lot people say he is going to say your Sister. Link might have a connection to The Royal Family cause in the novel his father was a knight but Zelda being his sister I doubt it. So the 1st thing you have to do is save Zelda & get her to this Church so she can be hid. You have to find 3 Pendants that will allow you to get The Master Sword this game introduces The Master Sword. You'll have a few side quests to get items you need to get to each dungeon or will help you complete it The Light World Dungeon music is another track that scared me as a kid[...]Also Aghnim has framed you for kidnapping Princess Zelda when you get The Master Sword Guards have taken Zelda killed The Priest so you have to head into the area of the castle where you weren't allowed to enter before cause The Master Sword can break the seal. Aghnim makes you watch as he sends Zelda to The Dark World. When you face Aghnim you can't fight him head on you have to play Dead Man's Volley as it's called. When he's beat Aghnim draws you into The Dark World & if you have The Moon Peral from The Tower Of Hera then you won't change shape into a bunny. Going back can be a hassle. This man you meet before the 1st Light World Dungeon Sahasrahla contacts you telepathically & that you have to free all The Maidens & Zelda & that is the only way defeating Aghnim & Ganon. The Dark World has no human's everyone has been turned into a beast or some kind of animal that represents what's in their mind & heart. It might be best to try to upgrade your weapons whenever you can like you shield & you can upgrade The Master Sword when you save this Blacksmith who is trapped in The Dark World. You can get a powerful Golden Sword near the end. The Boomerange can be powered up to reach further when you keep throwing in rupee's to summon a Great Fairy. I like how you can increase the number of arrows & bombs you can carry. The Silver Arrow's return too mainly to defeat Ganon. Other items you need is like from The Desert Temple The Power Glove that allows you to pick up heavy rocks. In the 4th dark world dungeon you get The Titan's Mitt that let's you pick up even heavier rocks & stones. I mentioned you must get The Moon Peral from The Tower Of Hera cause it allows you to keep your human form in The Dark World. Another must have item to even get to the 2nd temple is The Pegasus Boots that Sahasrahla. that let's you move faster & you have to use them to knock The Book Of Madora off a book shelf in Kakariko Village which that book is the only way you can enter The Desert Temple. The 3 Medallions you get are very handy. The items you get in The Dark World such as the hammer in the 1st Dark World dungeon The Hookshot in the 2nd Dark World Dungeon. The Fire Rod in The Forest Temple in The Dark World. The Titan's Mitt mentioned about already in the 4th Dark World dungeon. Then in the 5th Dark World dungeon you get The Blue Mail that reduces the amount of damage you take. The 6th Dark World dungeon contains The Cane Of Somaria that create these blocks that can weigh switches down it can also get create a block that can get you to the other side of the room like in Turtle Rock. Also in Turtle Rock you get The Mirror Shield. In Ganon's Tower you obtain The Red Mail which reduces the amount of damage you take even more. Basically you need all the items to complete the game such as The Ice Rod, Zora Flippers, The Magic Cape, Cane Byrna. There are a couple of side quests that stand out in my mind like the 1 where you get the flute there is this old man & his grandson is missing there is this boy that looks similar to Link & anytime you approach him he disappears it's cause he's dead. In The Dark World you find this animal or whatever it is standing on a tree stump you find out that is Flute Boy cause he went to The Dark World & was killed. With this flute you now have access to a bird that will fly you place to place & this lost old man in the caves leading to Death Mountain & he gives you the mirror that can take you back to The Light World. This game is 1 of the 1st times I believe that Nintendo allowed death in their games. So the game started a dark tone in Zelda games. I mentioned the glitches & how they made this game feels fresh I tried them out there kind of funny like you can face Aghnim while you have Zelda with you & Aghnim is sending Zelda to The Dark World it's like you got Zelda out of her cell so who is Ganon sending to The Dark World. Plus you know it's night time when you start the game & it's raining well if you do the glitch where you beat the game in like 5 minutes then in the ending it's night time & it's still raining. My favorite glitch is where you have the mirror & The Moon Peral ok & you can keep going back & forth from The Light World to The Dark World near the broken bridge & you can explore The Dark World before you even face Aghnim the 1st time. Just make sure you have the mirror, The Moon Peral & The Master Sword. Stuff you have to figure out like how to get The Big Key or the item in each dungeon is great. The bosses were all good The Ball & Chain Trooper who is in the castle. To The Armos Knights which a lot of fun. The boss of The Desert Temple Twinmola it's a good pattern type boss. The Tower Of Hera Moldorm is annoying cause if it knocks you off the ledge then you got to fight the boss all over again. The 1st Aghnim fight is good cause you have to knock it's attacks back at him. The Dark World dungeon bosses are well done some are harder than others such as Arrghus, Mothela, The Blind Thief & Trinexx. The 1st Dark World dungeon boss isn't too hard Helmasaur King you just use your hammer bust away at the metal on his face & fire arrows at the middle of it's head. In The 2nd Dark World Dungeon you battle Arrghus who is a big eyeball surrounded by several small eyes which you have to use The Hookshot to pull the eyes away & slash away with The Master Sword until you have to fight the giant eye. Mothula in The 3rd Dark World Dungeon while difficult all you need is The Fire Rod to beat it. The Blind Thief is hard cause it has 2 or 3 heads attacking you. In The 5th Dark World dungeon you face Kholdstare which is kind of a pain. You also have to have the bird to get to The 6th Dark World dungeon & the boss is Vitreous who is sort of like Arrghus but not as hard. To get into Turtle Rock you have to have The Quake Medallion & to get through it you have to have The Cane Of Somaria. This dungeon is a big pain cause you have to light torches to open some doors & if 1 torch goes out then the door will close. The boss Trinexx in it's 1st phase where you use The Fire & Ice Rod's isn't hard when you fight in it's 2nd phase then it's more of a challenge & I recommend that you get plenty of red or blue potion or some fairies on hand for The Dark World dungeon bosses. When you beat The 7 Dark World dungeon youu free a Maiden & finally Princess Zelda. Which takes you to Ganon's Tower where you fight the 3 Light World dungeon bosses again & have the 2nd & final encounter with Aghnim. Which the 2nd battle with Agahnim is a little bit harder. The final boss is Ganon & Ganon is the hardest of any Zelda game cause it takes 4 Silver Arrow's this time instead of 1 & when stomps the floor the ends start to break off & if you're knocked off the ledge you have to start the battle all over again. I think A Link To The Past Ganon is harder than Ganon in The NES original or Ocarina Of Time. But when you beat Ganon you are treated to a great ending. I know this has been a long read & I said my next reviews for The Zelda games are going to be really long so just a warning. This game is amazing bottom line while love Ocarina Of Time & enjoyed Majora's Mask & Twilight Princess this still remains my favorite Zelda game. If you never played Legend Of Zelda A Ling To The Past you should & play it any way you can cause you will miss out on 1 of the best games of the 90's\n",
      "Ok I am continuing my reviews for The Zelda games I own cause I don't own every Zelda game. This Zelda game is without a doubt favorite Legend Of Zelda A Link To The Past Which for any of those who don't know was suppose to be called Zelda III The Triforce Saga. But since The NES was near the end of it's life span Nintendo decided to go for The SNES. If any game deserves the title of Zelda III cause I think of the 1st 2 Zelda games on The NES & A Link To The Past as a Triforce Saga. Now after Zelda II wasn't what everybody wanted even though I didn't mind it they decided to go back to an overhead view & drop The RPG elements go back to using Rupee's & weapons instead of using all magic attacks. If I could give this game all the stars in the world I would if I am a fanboy for this game then color me a fanboy. I played this game a lot along with Mario All Stars & Street Fighter II Turbo back in the day. Even now hearing about all the glitches & preforming them this game is feels fresh & this game is 21 years old. This game brings a lot to the table like the tone which would be used in Ocarina Of Time & big time in Majora's Mask as well for Twilight Princess. This game started the dark tone in a Zelda games. You have this character Aghnim he not only collects the money from The King for helping him he then kills The King & takes these Maidens that are ancestors to The Wise Men he seals them into The Dark World. The Dark World is the land where The Triforce is at people who go to The Dark World don't come back & they change shape. It's a twisted version of Hyrule. Link is framed by Aghnim a kid gets sick from the evil air coming from Death Mountain. You have this kid who plays the flute who is dead. The next reviews I do for The Zelda games will go more in depth this game was released in Japan in 1991 & a few months later in The Spring of 92 The name of this game in Japan is The Legend Of Zelda The Triforce Of The Gods. The story is Ganon tries to get his hands on The Triforce he enters The Golden Land The King has 7 Wise Men put a seal on the enterance to The Golden Land which it seems that he's been sealed there forever. Hundreds of years later a drought a famine & illnesses have spread through Hyrule The King thought it had something to do with The Golden Land but the seal was intact a Wizard or a Satanic Priest however you want to look at I prefer what Aghnim was in The Japanese version. Aghnim shows up & ends the problems with Hyrule, The King was looking for decendents of The 7 Wise Men Aghnim helped him find them then he got a big role in The Kingdom Aghnim's intentions came clear he murdered The King Of Hyrule put a mind control spell on The Guards had The Maidens rounded up & sent them to The Dark World which this is all told in the opening & it really showed off the power of The SNES plus that music by Koji Kondo is great which ALTTP is my favorite Zelda score Ocarina Of Time is 2nd the opening music where it shows Aghnim sending The Madiens to The Dark World scared me as a kid.[...]Princess Zelda is locked up she sends out a telepathic message 1 of the people who get it is Link & this is not The same Link from the 1st 2 games & this is not the Zelda you save from the 1st game or the sleeping Zelda from part II. Link's Uncle decides he's going to see what that Aghnim guy is up to he tells Link not to leave the house. Well he does anyway you head for The Castle & find a secret passageway where you find your Uncle has been badly injured he gives you his sword & shield he never finish'e his sentence & there is a lot of debate about what he wants to say he says Princess Zelda is your a lot people say he is going to say your Sister. Link might have a connection to The Royal Family cause in the novel his father was a knight but Zelda being his sister I doubt it. So the 1st thing you have to do is save Zelda & get her to this Church so she can be hid. You have to find 3 Pendants that will allow you to get The Master Sword this game introduces The Master Sword. You'll have a few side quests to get items you need to get to each dungeon or will help you complete it The Light World Dungeon music is another track that scared me as a kid[...]Also Aghnim has framed you for kidnapping Princess Zelda when you get The Master Sword Guards have taken Zelda killed The Priest so you have to head into the area of the castle where you weren't allowed to enter before cause The Master Sword can break the seal. Aghnim makes you watch as he sends Zelda to The Dark World. When you face Aghnim you can't fight him head on you have to play Dead Man's Volley as it's called. When he's beat Aghnim draws you into The Dark World & if you have The Moon Peral from The Tower Of Hera then you won't change shape into a bunny. Going back can be a hassle. This man you meet before the 1st Light World Dungeon Sahasrahla contacts you telepathically & that you have to free all The Maidens & Zelda & that is the only way defeating Aghnim & Ganon. The Dark World has no human's everyone has been turned into a beast or some kind of animal that represents what's in their mind & heart. It might be best to try to upgrade your weapons whenever you can like you shield & you can upgrade The Master Sword when you save this Blacksmith who is trapped in The Dark World. You can get a powerful Golden Sword near the end. The Boomerange can be powered up to reach further when you keep throwing in rupee's to summon a Great Fairy. I like how you can increase the number of arrows & bombs you can carry. The Silver Arrow's return too mainly to defeat Ganon. Other items you need is like from The Desert Temple The Power Glove that allows you to pick up heavy rocks. In the 4th dark world dungeon you get The Titan's Mitt that let's you pick up even heavier rocks & stones. I mentioned you must get The Moon Peral from The Tower Of Hera cause it allows you to keep your human form in The Dark World. Another must have item to even get to the 2nd temple is The Pegasus Boots that Sahasrahla. that let's you move faster & you have to use them to knock The Book Of Madora off a book shelf in Kakariko Village which that book is the only way you can enter The Desert Temple. The 3 Medallions you get are very handy. The items you get in The Dark World such as the hammer in the 1st Dark World dungeon The Hookshot in the 2nd Dark World Dungeon. The Fire Rod in The Forest Temple in The Dark World. The Titan's Mitt mentioned about already in the 4th Dark World dungeon. Then in the 5th Dark World dungeon you get The Blue Mail that reduces the amount of damage you take. The 6th Dark World dungeon contains The Cane Of Somaria that create these blocks that can weigh switches down it can also get create a block that can get you to the other side of the room like in Turtle Rock. Also in Turtle Rock you get The Mirror Shield. In Ganon's Tower you obtain The Red Mail which reduces the amount of damage you take even more.

      "Mario is back in this newest accrual to the World of Nintendo, but there's a new face in the Mushroom Kingdom. In addition to all your favorite characters - Princess Toadstool, Bowser, Yoshi, and everyone else - Mario Mario's equally Italian-sounding brother, Luigi Mario, has finally made an appearance. The much anticipated Luigi has always been spoken of and conceptualized by fans of the games, but only now do we see his true identity. Much like a mixture of Mario and Waluigi, Luigi wears the color scheme of green with blue overalls, an inverse to Mario's red. This plumber also sports a green cap with the letter \"L\" adorned on the front as a means of further identification. Don't think Luigi is just like Mario, however - they might be genetically affiniates, but Luigi appears both taller and skinnier in figure. Luigi has brown hair with black eyebrows and moustache. Logistically, Luigi has the ability to jump higher than Mario, however Mario is in many situations easier to control. This makes the two comparatively equal in overall manuverability, but I'm sure some will make a choice as to which character they ultimately prefer.Luigi Mario is full of his own idiosyronous personality traits. He is said to be more nervous and cowardly than his brother, which explains his extended absence from the ironically-titled Mario Bros games. With his wavery, nasal voice and shifty footwork, nothing is funnier than this absurd Italian co-star. Finally Nintendo has granted the world a chance to play as BOTH Mario brothers, and there are even places in this game where Luigi takes the limelight as sole playable character.What are you waiting for?\n",

Included is a very lengthy campaign, numerous individual maps that begin you with no units and require speed, efficiency, and power to take the enemy's main base, and a 3-hour tutorial on the game's basics.Recommended to all who have a craving for intense, turn-based strategy on the almost-already-venerable Gameboy Advance.\n",

      "This game is great. You can either duel it out with up to 3 of you're freinds(plus you) or do a single player campaign. Let me explain single player campaign first. A deadly virus kills 99% of women in the game and so the National Guard takes the reamaining women to a Quarantine Zone. In the game,you are Griffin Spade and you must rescue Madison from the Federal Relocation Forces(earlier reffered to as the National Guard). To progress in the game,you must destroy enemy tanks and bunkers,destroy enemy bases prior to rescueing the queenlords inside them(the last base is the Quarantine Zone in Snfrinsisco),take the queenlords to you're base via you're tank,earn new types of Tanks as you progress(Goliath,M1A1,and a minature one),gain ally tanks by earning points(note:you can't get ally tanks until after rescueing the first qeenlord),and gain Power Ups which provide you're tank with sheilds,replacement armor(if you're tank gets damaged),weapons,and ammo. The capaign mode is really fun and has good replay value(considering you can get more tanks if you get more points than you did lst time),but it's still good to do multiplayer modes with freinds for both practice(to prepair for campaign mode) and fresh challenges(if you've beat campaign mode more than once). Plus campaign mode includes bonus rounds where you can earn extra points. Okay here's a list of all the multiplayer modes:Deathmatch:You must be on you're own against other players for this one,but you can get automatick gun terrets to assist you.Annilation:Depending on the gang you choose,you get a certain number of Goliaths,minature tanks(similar in size to gun terrets,and of course,M1A1's.

      "Excelente juego. Es muy diferente a cualquier juego de v&iacute;deo. Obliga a pensar y a moverse, dos cosas que en los v&iacute;deo juegos son muy escasas. los gr&aacute;ficos son simples, pero no se necesita mas. la m&uacute;sica es muy adictiva y divertida. Claro esta que uno no aguanta jugar por horas este juego, pero si lo anima a jugar un poco todos los d&iacute;as para seguir avanzando y eso es muy bueno con los ni&ntilde;os que normalmente se quedan pegados a un juego por horas.\n",
      "Este juego me encanta! El dise&ntilde;o de los personaje me encantan y la historia tambi&eacute;n. Cada calabozo es un reto100% Recomendado\n",
      "Este no es el juego tradicional de mover el control. Este es el juego de mover el cerebro y luego mover el control. Muy sencillo, muy divertido y permite jugar en familia. Tiene muchas opciones y es muy divertido. Mis hijos y yo lo jugamos juntos todo el tiempo y me gusta por que no me aburre y no los aburre a ellos.\n",
      "Es el juego que m&aacute;s les gust&oacute; a mis hijos de verdad que es sencillo pero muy entretenido. Adem&aacute;s Mario & Luigi hacen la diversi&oacute;n instant&aacute;nea.\n",

      "You know, I'm one of the few trying to keep the peace, and you know, fanboys are really bashing each system since te last time I was on this site. If you say the PS2's graphics are better than the Xbox's, my friend you're way in over head, and if you say the Xbox has better games, shoot, I don't have no idea where you've been for the past year, and if u shut the gamecube out, just because it basicly suits kids, then you're missing out on all the fun. I don't know who said they rather play the Atari instead of the PS2, if he had one, he'd definitly be playing the PS2, mabe more than the Xbox, but who knows. If you say the Xbox is just another bad microsoft product, try it out and get Halo, and Splinter Cell, with your own soundtrack, you'll be amazed, and if you shut out the gamecube, because of it's tastes(basicly kids) then give it a shot, and you might think kid games ain't so bad(heck they even have enough adult games, so I dunno why they keep saying it's best for kids, but the everyone rated games are a ton of fun). I mean, surley this looks like a waste of a reiview, but in my mind, all systems are good, and I'm really tired of 1 console owning fanboys bashing other consoles(Maybe their upset that they don't have a job, and don't have all the systems, and they just want to write a childish review to make the fell better, I dunno). I'm sure alot of people are tired of this nonsence console wars. I mean I can't even look up on reviews about multiplatform games, without saying this console stinks and this one rules. FOR GOD'S SAKE STOP!! I mean if you're gonna review a game write a honest and your true opinions about a game or console, not a false one, just to make you fell better. Advertising other consoles on other console pages are just dumb. I'll recomend this for ya tho, if you want the best console for games, you can't resist, get the PS2, If you want the strongest game console to date and want pure eye candy, and you're own soundtrack, who's stoppin you grab a Xbox. If you want a good dose of Technology and games, the gamecube is sure the suit your tastes. Well I hope this review is useful, and to me, console wars are straight up childish.\n",

      "Hey! So I'm assuming that you are reading this because you what the game is but you are a little unsure on whether you want this game or not. RIGHT? If you have absolutely no idea what this game is about, don't waste your time here, go do some research first (google it!). The point of this is to help you decide, this is not a review that will tell you my opinion and let you learn more about this game. If you want to learn a little more about this game first, you should go read other reviews and come back to this. So, keep on reading if you know what this game is about and is UNSURE on whether to get this game or not.Let me guess, probably from seeing all these positive reviews right? I had the same experience too. All my friends got it and said it was amazing but I was still unsure about wether to get it or not. IF THIS IS YOU... then I'm going to help you a bit :) if not, don't waste time reading this. Go right read other reviews.OK. To help you decide, go through the little \"flowchart\" I've made. Start with #1, read it and answer yes or no. After you've done that, go the the next question corresponding to your answer. Let me help you with the first question, Do you enjoy shooting games? if your answer was no, you would go read #3 and then answer that question to go to the next and the next until you've reached a verdict.1) Do you enjoy shooting games? YES (go to #2) NO (go to #3)2) Are you good with the touch-screen on the 3DS? YES (go to #5) NO (go to #7)3) Is this game a present? YES (go to #13) NO (go to #4)4) Do you play your 3DS at home more than on the go? YES (go to #6) NO (go to #9)5) Do you play more than 30 min at a time? YES (go to #8) NO (go to #7)6) Are you interested in trying a shooting game? YES (go to #5) NO (go to #10)7) Do you get frustrated easily? YES (go to #10) NO (go to #4)8) Like playing with friends? YES (go to #11) NO (go to #12)9) Have steady hands? YES (go to #5) NO (go to #10)10) Tight on money? YES (go to C) NO (go to B)11) Have little or no games on your 3DS? YES (go to A) NO (go to B)12) Do you like collecting every items in a game? YES (go to #11) NO (go to #10)13) Is this person 10 or older? YES (go to A) NO (go to C)A) GET THIS GAME! WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR???B) YOU'LL LOVE THIS GAME. BUT NOT NOW. MAYBE LATER. Buy only if you get that \"urge\" of getting this game. If you don't know what I'm talking about... don't get this yet. I would recommend waiting for a price drop or a special deal.C) Nah, maybe you should think about it more. You might end up wasting your money on a game you're not going to enjoy. (I'm not saying you won't but you should do some more research before you decide)\n",
      "This is an excellent iteration of the Kid Icarus series, perfectly capturing the gameplay of the original Kid Icarus for the Nintendo Entertainment System, with some welcome tweaks to gameplay that make it an even more excellent title.  It is a little easier than the original, because of intelligent features like being able to move backward and forward in a level.  In the climbing levels it is nice to not die just because the screen moved above a platform.  I was really enjoying this game full of hearty joy, but then when I got to the fourth level my save game was lost.  That is what you'll want to check for as a buyer.  The save game feature worked great for me for quite a while, probably a week of consistent gaming.  Then I must have done something wrong when I was saving, because when I turned the game on, it wouldn't allow me to access the continue option.  Unfortunately, prior to listing this review I haven't gotten to the bottom of this problem, but I just want to offer this advice.  Play this game as soon as you get it.  If there is a saved game, good, that is a good sign, but then you should also play this game until you can save it at the end of the first level.  Save, then shut it down, turn it back on, and then see if your game is saved.  If so congratulations, you have purchased a good copy.  If not, then the seller has sold you a flawed copy, unless they specifically stated that the save feature doesn't work, then you'll want to see if the seller will issue a refund.  This should require you to mail the game to the seller who will issue the refund when they get the game.  If they let you keep it, you are lucky, but what have you gotten, besides a game that you cannot shut off if you want to get to the end of the game...\n",

      "I am shocked at how many people have given this game such a bad review. This is actually a good solid game that is a lot of fun. You play as Mickey Mouse in a \"Myst\" style game format (anyone remember Myst for the PC and Playstation?), where, yes it IS a point and click type game but far more interactive and spunky than Myst was. The graphics in this game are vibrant and smooth, doing thier job well to make you feel like you are in a Disney movie. Mickey is silly and happy throughout the game, saying cute things, or singing, or even doing a little dance type thing from time to time, depending on what kinds of things you are doing in the game. The environment is pretty interactive too, allowing you to check out a number of different things in each room. There are more things to do in this game than \"point and click\", however. Sometimes you will need to do things to trigger an event, such as riding a train, blowing out a candle, jumping on a bed, and much more. You can also do these \"tricks\" to cause events to happen which further your progress in the game, plus there are a few mini-games such as snowboarding where you actually control Mickey directly.This is a great game for kids too because it is NOT VIOLENT which is becoming a rarity in games these days.Overall I find this a delightful little adventure game for \"kids\" of all ages.\n",

      "Excellent game console system has much more accessories than the GBA SP you can accessorize so much more with this game system because they made more accessories for this one. Excellent system plays well exactly to a tee like the GBA SP only difference it doesn't fold and doesn't have a back light like the GBA SP but you can get the light for the original GBA on amazon for 2 or 3 bucks if that.  Really cheap basically.  Even this system because it's been out a while you can get it really cheap which is really good if you don't want to pay more to get a gba sp I mean this system is the same exact thing still plays any kind of game boy advance game, game boy color game, and let's not forget the original game boy games. I recommend this game system for and anyone who plays gb, gbc, and gba games. WHO EVER BUY'S THIS GAME SYSTEM YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED IT'S STILL GAME BOY ADVANCE JUST CHEAPER HELLO?!? DUH THIS IS A STEAL FOR ANYONE WHO LOVE GAME BOY GAMES GAME BOY COLOR GAMES AND GAME BOY ADVANCE GAMES.

      "This game is so much fun, i get home from school everyday and have to fight over it with my siblings. Not just for little kids I play it almost 3 hours straight and it never gets old. If you ever need to just kill some time then definitely buy this game. I would recommend this game to anyone one under the age of 50, and who plays video games over that age anyways. I like the fact that you can play with friends to and watching this game isn't boring either. All and all I would rate this game well above all others of its kinds. I really can't say enough about this game. It has gotten great reviews from many people and sources so please do yourself a favor and buy it. I went through amazon with my new account and it was quick and easy plus it was cheaper than buying it at the store even with shipping. I feel like no matter what you do you can't go wrong with purchasing anything through amazon. The game again is wonderful it show how far graphics have come since just a few years ago when I played games similar to this one. If you only buy one game this year you need to check this one out and buy it right now. I cant believe your still reading this you need to be buying the game right now!! Come on! Do it!!! Good old days gaming\n"
